                    <p class="section-intro">It's normal to have questions about relationship therapyâ€”especially if you've never done it before or if you're unsure whether your relationship issues warrant professional help. Here are honest answers to common concerns.</p>

                    <div class="faq-grid">
                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>"Do both people need to participate in relationship therapy?"</h4>
                            <p>While it's helpful when both people participate, it's not required. Individual therapy focused on communication skills and relationship patterns can significantly improve your relationships even if the other person isn't involved in therapy.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>"What if my partner doesn't believe in therapy?"</h4>
                            <p>You can work on your side of relationship dynamics individually. Often, when one person changes their communication patterns, it naturally shifts the entire relationship dynamic. Many people find their partners become more interested in therapy as they see positive changes.</p>

                            <h4>"How do I know if our problems are serious enough for therapy?"</h4>
                            <p>If relationship issues are affecting your daily happiness, causing regular stress, or if you find yourselves having the same conflicts repeatedly without resolution, those are good indicators that therapy could be helpful. You don't need to wait for a crisis.</p>

                            <h4>"Will the therapist take sides or tell us what to do?"</h4>
                            <p>Good relationship therapy isn't about taking sides or giving specific advice about what you should do. Instead, it's about helping you develop skills, understand patterns, and make your own informed decisions about your relationships.</p>

                            <p>Confidentiality is paramount in therapy. Everything discussed is protected by professional confidentiality laws. We also work at your comfort levelâ€”you control how much detail you share and when.</p>

                            <p>This varies based on your goals and the complexity of the issues. Some people see improvements in communication within a few sessions, while others prefer longer-term support as they navigate ongoing relationship changes.
