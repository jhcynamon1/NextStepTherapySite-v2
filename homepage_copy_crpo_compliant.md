## APPROACH SECTION

### Section Title:
**Why This Approach Works**

### Content:

**Evidence-Based Methods That Make Sense**
Forget the therapy clichés. Using Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and proven psychological frameworks, we'll develop practical skills you can actually use. This isn't about endless talking - it's about finding what works for your real life.

**Your Pace, Your Process**
There's no one-size-fits-all timeline for therapy. Some weeks we might make huge breakthroughs, others we'll take it slow. I adapt evidence-based methods to fit your life, not the other way around.

**We're in This Together**
You're the expert on your life - I'm just here with the tools and training to help you navigate it better. No judgment, no telling you what to do. Just genuine collaboration toward the changes you want to see.

## PROCESS SECTION

### Section Title:
**How We'll Work Together**

### Four Steps:

**1. Initial Connection**
We start with a free 15-minute call - just a conversation about what's bringing you to therapy and whether we'd work well together. No pressure, no obligations.

**2. Getting the Full Picture**
Our first few sessions are about understanding your whole story - not just the problem, but what makes you you. We'll identify patterns without pathologizing your entire existence.

**3. Building Your Toolkit**
This is where we get practical. Using proven approaches, we'll develop strategies that actually work when you're in the middle of a panic attack, not just in theory.

**4. Real Change, Real Time**
Change isn't linear - some weeks are breakthroughs, others feel stuck. I'm here for all of it, adjusting our approach as life happens.
