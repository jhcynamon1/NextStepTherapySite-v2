# Claude Content Production PRD - 5 New SEO Pages

## 1. Objective

The primary goal of this PRD is to commission the creation of 5 new, high-quality, SEO-optimized landing pages. The purpose of these pages is to continue validating the "Digital Landlord" SEO strategy by targeting high-volume, low-competition keywords that we have identified through data analysis.

## 2. Global Mandates (MUST READ - NON-NEGOTIABLE)

These rules apply to ALL 5 articles without exception.

*   **Master Template:** All pages MUST adhere strictly to the structure, tone, and requirements outlined in the `LANDING_PAGE_PRODUCTION_PRD_V3.md` document. This is the foundational guide for all content.
*   **CRPO Compliance:** This is the most critical constraint. All content must be ethical, professional, and compliant with the College of Registered Psychotherapists of Ontario standards. Avoid making promises, guarantees of results, or using overly promotional language. The tone must be supportive and informative.
*   **Branding & Tone:** The voice should be empathetic, professional, supportive, and authoritative. It must align perfectly with the existing `nextsteptherapy.ca` website.
*   **Call to Actions (CTAs):** Use the standard CTAs for a "Free Consultation" as specified in the V3 PRD.
*   **Technical SEO:** All schema (`FAQPage`, `LocalBusiness`, etc.), meta descriptions, title tags, and other technical requirements from the V3 PRD must be fully implemented for each page.

## 3. The Pillar Page Strategy (For Thematic Pages Only)

For the "Workplace Burnout" and "Teen Eating Disorder" pages, we will use a sophisticated **Pillar Page** model. This is designed to capture traffic from both broad, informational searches (e.g., "what is burnout") and multiple specific, local searches (e.g., "burnout therapist toronto") on a single page.

**Pillar Page Structure:**

1.  **H1 Title:** A broad, engaging, guide-style title.
2.  **Introduction:** Hook the reader by validating their problem and introducing the scope of the guide.
3.  **Comprehensive Body Content:** Use H2s and H3s to create detailed sections covering the core topic (e.g., "What is Burnout?", "Common Signs & Symptoms", "How Therapy Helps"). This section should be rich with semantic keywords.
4.  **The Local Bridge (CRITICAL SECTION):**
    *   Create a dedicated H2 section titled something like "Finding [Topic] Therapy In Ontario".
    *   Under this H2, create H3s for the top 5-7 major Ontario cities (e.g., Toronto, Ottawa, Mississauga, Hamilton, London, Kitchener, Windsor).
    *   For each city, write 1-2 unique paragraphs that naturally incorporate the local keyword (e.g., "For those seeking **burnout therapy in Toronto**, our clinic offers specialized programs..."). This allows us to rank for local terms without creating dozens of thin pages.
5.  **FAQ Section:** Include a robust FAQ section with 5-7 questions and answers. Implement the `FAQPage` schema here.
