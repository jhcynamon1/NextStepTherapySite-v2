---

## Skills NOT Adapted (Why)

### ❌ content-atomizer
**Reason:** Therapy content doesn't atomize well to TikTok/Instagram. CRPO limits on short-form claims. Wrong channel for therapy practice.

**Alternative:** Focus on blog posts, service pages, and educational long-form content.

---

### ❌ newsletter
**Reason:** Not a priority for therapy practice. Patients don't subscribe to therapist newsletters. Email welcome sequences more valuable.

**Alternative:** Use email-welcome-sequence-therapy for nurture.

---

### ❌ seo-content (as standalone)
**Reason:** therapy-content-generator already does this + YMYL compliance. Only merged the "Humanize" section.

**What was kept:** Phase 5 (Humanize) merged into therapy-content-generator.

---

## AAA Framework + brand-voice Integration

**Status:** In progress (separate from Vibe skills)

**How it connects:**
1. Complete AAA 39-question interview (currently at Q7/39)
2. Extract Voice DNA (5 layers) + Disgust Mapper
3. Run Vibe's brand-voice Extract mode on interview transcript
4. Generate formal Voice Profile document
5. Reference Voice Profile in all Vibe skills adapted above

**Timeline:**
- AAA Interview: Continue Q8-39
- Voice DNA extraction: After interview complete
- brand-voice Extract: After Voice DNA
- Skills use Voice Profile: Ongoing as content is created

---

## How to Use These Skills

### Typical Workflow

3. Use direct-response-copy-therapy to write hero section
4. Use therapy-content-generator (enhanced) to write full page
5. Use faq-schema-generator to add FAQ section
```

**2. Building email list:**
```
1. Use lead-magnet-therapy to create concept (e.g., "Is Therapy Right for You?" guide)
2. Use direct-response-copy-therapy for landing page
3. Use email-welcome-sequence-therapy for nurture after opt-in
```

**3. Launching new service:**
```
1. Use keyword-research to validate keyword
2. Use positioning-angles-therapy to find angle
3. Use therapy-content-generator (enhanced) to write page

```

## Testing Recommendations

**Before using adapted skills in production:**

1. **Test positioning-angles-therapy:**
   - Generate angles for "anxiety therapy Ontario"
   - Verify all angles pass CRPO compliance
   - Confirm no outcome promises

2. **Test email-welcome-sequence-therapy:**
   - Generate 5-email sequence
   - Read out loud for tone check
   - Verify no pressure tactics

3. **Test lead-magnet-therapy:**
   - Create one concept ("Is Therapy Right for You?")
   - Verify it's not a diagnostic assessment
   - Get feedback: "Could this be mistaken for clinical assessment?"

4. **Test direct-response-copy-therapy:**
   - Write hero section for existing page
   - Compare to current version
   - Verify tone is empathetic, not dramatic

5. **Test therapy-content-generator (Humanize):**
   - Rewrite one section of existing page
   - Run AI detection tools (Originality.ai, GPTZero)
   - Read out loud to verify it sounds like Jesse

---

## Known Limitations

**What these skills CAN'T do:**

1. **Can't replace Jesse's voice entirely:** Skills provide frameworks, but final copy should be reviewed and adjusted to match voice profile.

2. **Can't guarantee CRPO compliance:** Skills include compliance checks, but Jesse should review all output for CRPO adherence.

3. **Can't write authentic personal stories:** Skills provide templates, but Jesse needs to provide real experiences/examples.

4. **Can't predict what will convert:** Skills use proven frameworks, but A/B testing is still required.

## Questions or Issues?

**If a skill outputs CRPO-violating content:**
1. Report it in conversation
2. Note which skill and what output
3. Refine the skill's compliance filter

**If tone doesn't match Jesse's voice:**
1. Complete AAA interview first (Q8-39)
2. Extract Voice DNA
3. Use brand-voice skill to formalize
4. Update all skills to reference Voice Profile

**If a skill is confusing:**
1. Read the skill's SKILL.md file
2. Look at the examples provided
3. Ask Claude to explain the skill in simpler terms
