# Brand Voice for Therapy

Ensuring all NextStep Therapy content sounds like Jesse Cynamon - not generic therapy copy, not AI-generated marketing speak, but authentically Jesse.

---

## The Core Job

**Apply** Jesse's existing Voice DNA to all content creation and verification.

**Critical:** Voice discovery is 100% COMPLETE. The 39-question AAA Framework interview extracted 545 lines of Jesse's exact voice patterns across 5 layers. This skill doesn't discover voice - it **applies** it.

**Two modes:**
1. **Apply Mode** - Use when writing new content
2. **Verify Mode** - Use when checking if content sounds like Jesse

## CRPO Voice Guardrails

### Voice Patterns That VIOLATE CRPO (Disguised as Authentic Voice)

Even when trying to sound like Jesse, these patterns cross CRPO lines:

| Pattern | Why It Violates | Fix |
|---------|-----------------|-----|
| "I've helped clients reduce their anxiety" | Outcome claim | "I work with clients dealing with anxiety" |
| "My clients tell me..." | Testimonial | "What I've observed in sessions..." |
| "I'm really good at working with anxiety" | Superlative | "I work with clients who deal with anxiety" |
| "Therapy with me will help you..." | Guarantee | "In therapy, we often explore..." |
| "Proven methods that get results" | Outcome promise | "Evidence-based approaches" |
| "Transform your relationship with anxiety" | Transformation claim | "Explore patterns in how you relate to anxiety" |

### Voice Patterns That ARE CRPO-Safe

| Safe Pattern | Why It Works |
|--------------|--------------|
| "I work with people dealing with..." | Factual service description |
| "What I've noticed is..." | Personal observation, not guarantee |
| "The approach I use focuses on..." | Describes method, not outcome |
| "In therapy, we often explore..." | Process-focused |
| "Jesse Cynamon, RP (CRPO #10979)" | Proper credential display |
| "Same-week appointments available" | Verifiable service feature |

**The rule:** If it sounds like a promise, rewrite it as a process.

## Voice DNA Quick Reference

### The "Jesse Voice" Formula

**6-step structure for any piece of content:**

1. **Start with disclaimer or "I don't know"**
   - "I can't speak for everyone, but..."
   - "I don't know if this will resonate..."
   - "I'm not sure I have the answer, but..."

2. **Give concrete example or personal feeling**
   - Brief client scenario (anonymized)
   - Personal experience as a therapist
   - Real situation, not abstract

3. **Move to concept/theory**
   - Connect to broader pattern
   - Introduce framework (ACT, person-centered)
   - Show the thinking behind it

4. **Reference authority (optional)**
   - AFTER expressing own thought
   - "Research supports..." / "Judson Brewer talks about..."
   - Never leads with authority

5. **Circle back to uncertainty or limitation**
   - "But I don't know if I'm doing that"
   - "That's been my experience, anyway"
   - "At least, that's what I've seen"

6. **Check in**
   - "Does that make sense?"
   - "Right?"
   - "Sound familiar?"

---

### Layer 1: Structural Patterns

**Opening Patterns - Disclaimers First:**
- "I don't know..."
- "I can't speak for..."
- "I'm not sure..."
- "This is going to be a conversation for later, but..."

**Mid-Sentence Check-Ins:**
- "right?" (use frequently)
- "Does that make sense?"
- "Is that enough?"
- "Does this answer the question?"

**Thought Flow:** Concrete example → Abstract concept → Authority reference → Circle back to uncertainty

**Paragraph Style:** Short bursts (2-4 sentences), longer for explanations, back to brief disclaimers

---

### Layer 2: Linguistic Patterns

**Signature Phrases (USE THESE):**
- "WITH the client, not ahead of the client" (major positioning)
- "Holding hands, walking through the unknown together"
- "Today's problems are yesterday's solutions"
- "Awareness is oftentimes a necessary precursor to change"
- "What's in your control and what's out of your control"
- "Should vs. want" (internalized expectations vs. authentic desire)
- "Speaking the same language"
- "Connection is everything"

**Key Therapy Verbs:**
- Unpack
- Untie knots
- Make sense (of things)
- Draw connections
- Make patterns
- Explore
- Figure out
- Sort through
- Process

**Word Substitutions:**
| Instead of... | Jesse says... |
|--------------|--------------|
| Patient | Client |
| Treatment | Work / Therapy |
| Fix | Explore / Understand |
| Expertise | Understanding |
| Maladaptive | "Served a purpose" / "Costs outweigh benefits" |
| Failed | "Worked at one time, don't work now" |

**Authorities Referenced (AFTER own thoughts):**
- Carl Rogers (person-centered therapy)
- Jonathan Shedler (psychodynamic, 3-part therapeutic alliance)
- Judson Brewer (mindfulness, anxiety, awareness)
- ACT Hexaflex / ACT Matrix

---

### Layer 3: Tonal Patterns

**Vulnerable but Not Apologetic:**
- Admits "I don't know" frequently (30+ times in interview)
- Honest about struggle/disconnection
- BUT doesn't apologize - owns the uncertainty

**Self-Awareness About Intellectualizing:**
- Acknowledges when giving theoretical answer
- "That's the intellectualized answer. I don't know if I'm actually doing that."

**Comfort with Uncertainty:**
- Genuine "I don't know" - not filler
- Hedges when making assertions: "I think...", "I feel like...", "Probably..."
- Resists superlatives

**Respectful Disagreement:**
- Acknowledges other approaches work
- "CBT apps are unbelievably helpful. You don't need a therapist for that."
- BUT states preference: "That's just not my approach"

---

### Layer 4: Narrative Patterns

**Client Examples (How to Tell Them):**
- Brief scenario + struggle + NO outcomes
- Anonymized, situation-focused
- Examples: "tech executive with work stress spilling into family", "lawyer dealing with procrastination"

**Metaphor Approach:**
- Prefers client-generated metaphors
- Tests metaphors: "Does that make sense?"
- Discards if feels "off"
- His metaphor: "Blindfolded cartographer drawing the map the client describes"

**Insight Delivery:**
- Through questions, not statements
- By contrasting what he won't do with what he aspires to
- Through admissions of what he doesn't know
- Show process, not just conclusion

---

### Layer 5: Ideological Patterns (Ranked)

**Core Beliefs to Convey:**

1. **Alliance/Connection is Everything**
   - Largest factor in outcomes (research-backed)
   - "If I don't feel understood, none of it matters"

2. **Client is Expert in Their Own Life**
   - Therapist provides space, not solutions
   - Person-centered (Carl Rogers)

3. **Awareness Before Change**
   - "Awareness is oftentimes a necessary precursor to change"
   - Can't change what you don't understand

4. **Compassion for "Maladaptive" Behaviors**
   - "Today's problems are yesterday's solutions"
   - Behaviors served a purpose - costs now outweigh benefits

5. **What's in Control vs. Out of Control**
   - Acceptance of what you can't control
   - Action on what you can

6. **"Should" vs. "Want" Distinction**
   - Should = internalized expectations from others
   - Want = authentic desire

7. **"WITH the Client, Not Ahead"**
   - Not the guide who knows the path
   - The companion who walks it with you

---

## The Core Tensions (Feature, Not Bug)

Jesse operates with productive tensions. These make his voice authentic:

| Tension | How It Shows Up |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Aspiration vs. Reality** | Can articulate ideal approach, unsure if delivering it |
| **Expert vs. Vulnerable** | Doesn't want to be "the expert," also doesn't want to seem broken |
| **Authenticity vs. Marketing** | Balancing genuine voice with conversion needs |
| **Theory vs. Practice** | Can explain ACT/person-centered, unsure if doing it |

**Why this is marketable:** It's honest. It's relatable. It's therapeutic.

**In content:** Acknowledge the tension. "I don't claim to have all the answers..." is MORE trustworthy than confident expertise claims.

---

## Apply Mode: Writing Templates

### For Service Pages

**Hero Section Structure:**
```
[Disclaimer or acknowledgment of the struggle]
[Concrete example of who you work with]
[What therapy offers - process, not outcome]
[Check-in or invitation]
```

**Example:**
> If anxiety has been running the show - making decisions for you, keeping you up at night, affecting your work and relationships - you're not alone. I work with people who are tired of white-knuckling through every day.
>
> I can't promise I'll make anxiety disappear. But I can walk through the unknown with you. We'll figure out what's in your control and what's not, what you actually want versus what you think you should want.
>
> That awareness piece? That's often where change starts. At least, that's what I've seen. Does that resonate?

**Section Flow:**
1. Hook with shared experience, not drama
2. Acknowledge uncertainty where honest
3. Describe process, not promise outcomes
4. Reference research/theory AFTER personal observation
5. End with invitation, not pressure

### For CTAs

**Voice Translations:**

| Generic CTA | Jesse's Voice |
|-------------|---------------|
| "Start Your Transformation Journey" | "Ready when you are" |
| "Get the Help You Deserve" | "Let's talk about what's going on" |
| "Book Now to Reduce Your Anxiety" | "Book a consultation - we'll figure out if it's a good fit" |
| "Take Control of Your Life" | "Let's explore what's in your control" |
| "Claim Your Free Consultation" | "Book a free 15-minute call" |

### For Emails

**Opening Patterns:**
- "I wanted to share something I've been thinking about..."
- "I don't know if this will resonate, but..."
- "Something came up in a session recently that made me think..."

**Closing Patterns:**
- "Does any of this land for you?"
- "I'm here if you want to talk about it."
- "No pressure - just something to think about."

### The 7-Question Voice Match Test

Run this on any content before publishing:

| Question | Jesse's Voice | Generic AI |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| 1. Does it start with a disclaimer or uncertainty? | "I don't know if..." | Confident opener |
| 2. Are there check-ins throughout? | "right?", "Does that make sense?" | No interaction |
| 3. Does it claim expertise or outcomes? | Never | Often |
| 4. Are signature phrases present? | "WITH you," "should vs want," "awareness" | Missing |
| 5. Is there vulnerability without apology? | Admits limits, owns them | Either overshares or hides |
| 6. Are examples concrete before theory? | Client scenario → concept | Theory dump |
| 7. Does it feel like Jesse talking? | Conversation with friend | Brochure |

**Scoring:**
- 7/7: Ready to publish
- 5-6/7: Light revision needed
- 4 or fewer: Significant rewrite required

---

### Read-Aloud Test

Before publishing, read the content out loud and ask:

1. **Would Jesse actually say this?** If it sounds like a brochure, rewrite.
2. **Is there a "right?" or "Does that make sense?" every few paragraphs?** Add if missing.
3. **Does it start with "I" or "You"?** Should start with acknowledgment, not claim.
4. **Can you hear Jesse's voice?** Or does it sound like any therapist?
5. **Would Jesse be embarrassed reading this?** If yes, it's too polished or claims too much.

---

## Example: Generic AI Copy vs. Jesse's Voice

### Generic AI Copy (BEFORE):

> As an expert therapist specializing in anxiety and depression, I provide evidence-based treatment that gets results. My proven ACT methodology helps clients overcome their challenges and achieve lasting change. With over X years of experience and a commitment to excellence, I've helped hundreds of people transform their lives.
>
> Take the first step toward the life you deserve. Book your consultation today and start your healing journey.

**What's wrong:**
- Claims expertise
- Promises outcomes
- No vulnerability
- Prescriptive ("my methodology")
- No client as expert
- Superlatives ("commitment to excellence")
- Transformation claims
- Pressure CTA

### Jesse's Voice (AFTER):

> I work with people dealing with anxiety, burnout, feeling disconnected from themselves. I can't promise I have all the answers - honestly, I don't think anyone does. But I can walk through the unknown with you.
>
> We'll figure out what's in your control and what's not, what you actually want versus what you think you should want. That awareness piece? That's often where change starts. At least, that's what I've seen. And what research backs up.
>
> Does that make sense?
>
> If this resonates, book a free 15-minute consultation. We'll figure out if it's a good fit - no pressure.

**What works:**
- Disclaimers ("I can't promise," "I don't think")
- "WITH you" positioning
- Key concepts: control, should vs. want, awareness
- Check-in at end ("Does that make sense?")
- References research AFTER personal observation
- No outcome promises
- Soft CTA with "no pressure"
