## ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUES TO FIX

### 1. **CRPO Compliance Violations (MODERATE RISK)**

**Found 3 violations that need addressing:**

| Word | Occurrences | Location | Fix Required |
|------|------------|----------|--------------|
| "treatment" | 2x | Section heading: "My Approach to Anxiety Treatment" | Change to "My Approach to Anxiety Therapy" |
| "cure" | 2x | In HIPAA text (false positive - it's "secure") | No action needed (misread) |
| "heal" | 7x | Multiple references to "mental health" | This is acceptable (referring to field, not promising healing) |

**Assessment**: Only the word "treatment" needs fixing. "Mental health" is acceptable industry terminology.

### 2. **Visual Issues (Still Present)**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **CTA buttons may have contrast issues** (needs testing)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No visible trust bar** (missing trust indicators section)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Hero text centering** (needs verification on mobile)

### 3. **Minor Copy Refinements**
- Section heading uses "Treatment" instead of "Therapy"
- Could add more CTAs throughout (only 1 primary CTA found)
