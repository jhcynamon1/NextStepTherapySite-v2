<!-- Intro Section -->
<section class="section">
<h2 class="section-title">The Waterloo Grind Is Real</h2>
<p>You chose Waterloo because you wanted the best. The co-op program, the tech pipeline, the opportunities. What nobody told you was how relentless it would feel. Six courses while applying to jobs. Constant interviews. Moving every four months. Watching your ranking on WaterlooWorks like it determines your entire future—because sometimes it feels like it does.</p>

<p>You're surrounded by people who got 99% averages in high school. Everyone seems to have internships at Google and side projects on GitHub. Meanwhile, you're wondering if you actually belong here, or if admissions made a mistake. That thought keeps you up at night more than the problem sets.</p>

<p>The co-op cycle creates a unique kind of pressure. Interview seasons overlap with midterms. You get rejected from companies you desperately wanted. You see peers matching at FAANG while you're still applying to Round 2. The comparison is constant and exhausting. And then, just when you've finally settled into a routine, you're moving again—new city, new apartment, new coworkers, same underlying anxiety.</p>

<p>This isn't weakness. This is a rational response to an environment that demands constant performance with zero rest. The question isn't whether you should be stressed—of course you are. The question is whether you have support to manage it.</p>
</section>

<!-- Why Private Therapy -->
<section class="section">
<h2 class="section-title">Why Waterloo Students Choose Private Therapy</h2>
<p>UWaterloo Counselling Services is a valuable resource, especially for crisis support. But many students find they need something different—or something more—than what campus services can provide:</p>

<ul class="criteria-list">
<li><strong>No WaterlooWorks-Level Waitlists:</strong> Get support within days, not weeks. During interview season when stress peaks, campus counselling waitlists stretch. You need help now, not in three weeks.</li>
<li><strong>Continuity During Co-op:</strong> Campus services are designed for students on campus. What happens when you're working in Toronto, Ottawa, or California? Virtual therapy follows you wherever the co-op cycle takes you.</li>
<li><strong>More Than 6 Sessions:</strong> Campus counselling typically limits you to 6-8 sessions. For ongoing challenges like anxiety, imposter syndrome, or depression, that's often not enough. Private therapy supports you throughout your degree.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding Tech Culture:</strong> I work specifically with students in competitive programs who face imposter syndrome, interview anxiety, and the unique pressures of tech culture. You won't need to explain why LeetCode stress is real.</li>
<li><strong>Complete Privacy:</strong> Your mental health stays entirely separate from your academic institution. No notes in any university system. Some students prefer this separation completely.</li>
<li><strong>Scheduling Flexibility:</strong> Sessions between classes, during lunch breaks at work, or after hours. Your therapy fits your schedule, not the other way around.</li>
</ul>

<div style="background: #e8f5e9; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #c8e6c9;">
<p style="margin-bottom: 0; color: #2e7d32; font-weight: 500;"><strong>Cost Reality:</strong> The WUSA Student Health Plan covers registered psychotherapists (CRPO) typically $750-1,000 per year. At $175/session, that's 4-6 sessions covered. Graduate students (GSA) often have enhanced coverage. Plus, if you're under 25, you may also be covered by a parent's benefits for additional sessions.</p>
</div>

<!-- Waterloo-Specific Challenges -->
<section class="section">
<h2 class="section-title">Waterloo-Specific Challenges We Address</h2>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #4a7c59;">Co-op Interview Anxiety & WaterlooWorks Stress</h3>
<p>The WaterlooWorks cycle is unlike anything at other universities. You're applying to 50+ jobs while taking a full course load. You're preparing for technical interviews, behavioral interviews, and design interviews simultaneously. Every ranking feels like it determines your career trajectory. And when you don't match where you hoped, the disappointment hits hard—especially when your roommate just got Shopify.</p>

<p>We work on managing interview anxiety, processing rejection without spiraling, and developing a healthier relationship with the matching process. The goal isn't to stop caring—it's to care without being destroyed by every outcome.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #4a7c59;">Imposter Syndrome in Tech</h3>
<p>Waterloo attracts high achievers. When everyone around you seems brilliant, it's easy to conclude you're the exception—the one who doesn't belong. You discount your acceptances as luck. You assume everyone understands the material faster than you. You feel like you're constantly performing competence while secretly terrified of being exposed.</p>

<p>Imposter syndrome in tech is especially brutal because the culture rewards confidence and penalizes uncertainty. We work on understanding your patterns, building genuine (not performed) confidence, and developing self-compassion for the learning process.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #4a7c59;">The 4-Month Transition Cycle</h3>
<p>Most students move once per year. Waterloo students move every four months. New city, new apartment, new job, new coworkers, new routine—six times during undergrad for co-op students. Just when you've finally found a good coffee shop and maybe made a friend, you're packing boxes again.</p>

<p>This constant transition makes it nearly impossible to build deep relationships or establish stable routines. Therapy provides one consistent relationship throughout the chaos. I'm here whether you're in Waterloo, Toronto, San Francisco, or anywhere else the co-op cycle takes you.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #4a7c59;">Academic Pressure in Competitive Programs</h3>
<p>CS, Engineering, and Math at Waterloo are brutally competitive. The curve doesn't care about your mental health. Assignments are designed to challenge even the strongest students. And the workload never stops—there's always another assignment, another midterm, another project due.</p>

<p>When you're drowning in work while watching classmates seem to handle it effortlessly (they're not—they're just better at hiding it), the stress compounds. We develop practical strategies for managing workload, setting boundaries, and maintaining your mental health without sacrificing your academic goals.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #4a7c59;">Social Isolation & Building Connections</h3>
<p>Waterloo's campus culture is notoriously challenging socially. The co-op cycle means your friend group scatters every four months. The academic intensity leaves little time for socializing. And the stereotype of the "Waterloo nerd" creates its own pressure—should you even try to have a social life, or just accept isolation as part of the package?</p>

<p>Many students feel lonely despite being surrounded by thousands of peers. Therapy helps you navigate social anxiety, build connections that survive the co-op disruption, and find community in a challenging environment.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #4a7c59;">Career Uncertainty Despite "Success"</h3>
<p>You're in one of the best co-op programs in the country. You have internships other students would kill for. And yet... you're not sure this is what you actually want. The tech pipeline felt obvious at 17, but now you're questioning whether software engineering is your calling or just the path of least resistance.</p>

<p>Career uncertainty at Waterloo feels especially forbidden—you're supposed to be grateful for these opportunities, not questioning them. Therapy provides space to explore who you are beyond your GitHub profile and LinkedIn headline.</p>

<!-- Insurance Info -->
<section class="section">
<h2 class="section-title">Insurance & Cost for Waterloo Students</h2>
<p>Most full-time UWaterloo students are automatically enrolled in the Waterloo Undergraduate Student Association (WUSA) health insurance plan through StudentCare. This plan covers registered psychotherapists (CRPO), making therapy financially accessible.</p>

<ul class="criteria-list">
<li><strong>Undergraduates (WUSA):</strong> Typically $750-1,000 per year for psychotherapy services</li>
<li><strong>Graduate Students (GSA):</strong> Coverage varies by program—many have enhanced mental health benefits</li>
<li><strong>Direct Billing or Receipts:</strong> Easy pay-and-claim with same-day receipts for reimbursement</li>
<li><strong>During Co-op:</strong> Your student insurance typically continues during work terms</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Under 25?</strong> You may also be covered by a parent's workplace benefits in addition to your student coverage. International students should check their UHIP plan or supplemental coverage for mental health services.</p>
</section>

<!-- Virtual Therapy Benefits -->
<section class="section">
<h2 class="section-title">Virtual Therapy That Follows Your Co-op</h2>
<p>The biggest challenge with traditional therapy for Waterloo students? You move every four months. Starting over with a new therapist twice a year isn't just inconvenient—it's impossible to do deep work that way.</p>

<p>Virtual therapy solves this completely:</p>

<ul class="criteria-list">
<li><strong>Same Therapist, Any Location:</strong> Whether you're on campus, doing co-op in Toronto, working in Ottawa, or interning in California—same consistent support</li>
<li><strong>Fits Your Schedule:</strong> Sessions between classes, during lunch at work, or after hours. 50-minute sessions fit easily into busy days</li>
<li><strong>No Commute Required:</strong> Attend from your dorm, apartment, or a private room at work. Save time and energy for what matters</li>
<li><strong>Privacy Anywhere:</strong> No one at your co-op workplace knows you're accessing therapy. Complete discretion</li>
<li><strong>Interview Season Flexibility:</strong> Keep sessions during the most stressful periods without missing work or classes</li>
</ul>

<p>The technology is simple—just a device with a camera and internet connection. We'll do a brief tech check in your first session to ensure everything works smoothly.</p>

<!-- FAQ Section -->
<section class="section">
<h2 class="section-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>How do I know if I need therapy?</h3>
<p>If stress is interfering with your performance, relationships, or wellbeing—that's beyond "normal" Waterloo stress. Struggling to sleep before interviews? Constant anxiety about rankings? Feeling disconnected from friends? These are signs that support could help. You don't need to be in crisis to benefit from therapy.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Will my parents find out?</h3>
<p>Not unless you tell them. Therapy is completely confidential. Even if you use their insurance, they only see a claim for "psychological services"—never session content, topics discussed, or any details. Your mental health care is yours.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Can I continue therapy during work terms?</h3>
<p>Absolutely—that's the whole point of virtual therapy. I work with Waterloo students during both academic and co-op terms. Many find co-op transitions especially challenging and value having consistent support through the moves.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What if I've tried therapy before and it didn't help?</h3>
<p>Not all therapy is the same, and not all therapist matches work. If previous therapy felt unhelpful, we can discuss what worked and didn't, then do something different. Sometimes it's the approach; sometimes it's the fit; sometimes it's just timing.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>How long does therapy take?</h3>
<p>It depends on your goals. Some students work through specific issues (interview anxiety, a major rejection) in 6-8 sessions. Others prefer ongoing support throughout their degree. There's no minimum commitment—we work together as long as it's helpful.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Do you understand tech interview stress specifically?</h3>
<p>Yes. LeetCode anxiety, system design panic, behavioral question dread—I work with many students navigating technical interviews. We address both the practical stress management and the deeper patterns that make interviews feel so high-stakes.</p>
