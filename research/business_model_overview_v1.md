# The "Next Step" Vertical Incubator: Business Model Overview (V2)

## 1. The Strategic Thesis: "The Shopify for Therapists"
We are pivoting from a traditional "Group Practice" (which suffers from high churn and linear scaling costs) to a **Vertical Managed Service Organization (MSO)**.

**The Core Insight:**
*   **Old Model:** Therapists are employees/contractors. They leave when they get successful. (High Churn).
*   **New Model:** Therapists are "customers." We build their infrastructure. We succeed *when* they succeed. (High Retention).

We use our **Unfair Advantage** (pSEO Lead Engine + Vibe Coding Skills) to acquire therapists by solving their #1 problem (Lead Gen), then lock them in by solving their #2 problem (Ops/Tech), and monetize them through high-margin value-add services.

## 2. The "Trojan Horse" Acquisition Strategy
We do not sell "Consulting" or "Websites" cold. We sell **Caseloads**.

*   **The Hook:** "Join Next Step Therapy. We fill your caseload. You pay nothing upfront."
*   **The Structure:** Independent Contractors on a **Cost-Sharing Agreement (CSA)** or **Management Services Agreement (MSA)**. **NOT** an employment contract.
*   **The Split:** 70% to Therapist / 30% to Next Step (Initially).
*   **The Regulatory Fix:** The 30% is legally structured as a "Management Fee" for marketing, intake, and admin—not a referral commission.

## 3. The "Retention Lock" (Solving the Churn)
In a normal clinic, a therapist paying $4,000/mo (30% of $13k) leaves to go solo. In our model, we introduce:

**The "Partner Cap" (The Reverse Layla):**
*   Once a therapist hits ~$10k/mo revenue, their Management Fee **CAPS** at ~$2,100 - $2,500/mo (based on Red Team analysis).
*   **Effect:** They stop "overpaying" for success. They cannot replicate our stack (Leads + Admin + Tech) for less than $2,500 solo. They stay.
*   **The Math:** Keeping a therapist for 5 years at $2,500/mo ($150k LTV) is far more profitable than churning them every 18 months ($80k LTV) and suffering the ~$80k revenue loss during the vacancy gap.

## 4. The "Vibe Coding" Value Stack (The Upsell Engine)
This is where we move from "Low Margin Clinic" to "High Margin Tech Platform." We upsell or bundle proprietary tools that no generic clinic offers.

**Tier 1: The Standard Stack (Included in Cap)**
*   **Flow:** pSEO Lead Gen + AI Intake & Triage.
*   **Ops:** Billing, Scheduling (Jane App integration).
*   **Brand:** "Next Step" Directory Profile.

**Tier 2: The "Incubator" Stack (High Margin Upsells)**
*   **AI Clinical Scribe (White-Label):** "Never write a note again." Sticky infrastructure.
*   **Compliance-as-a-Service ("CFO in a Box"):** Tax & Bookkeeping package to reduce PSB fear.
*   **Custom AI Tools:** "Panic Tracker," "CBT Homework Gen" (White-labeled for them).
*   **Supervision Marketplace:** Peer-to-peer matching platform (we take a % fee).

*Note: We are deprioritizing "Web Design" (Commodity Trap) and focusing on "Infrastructure" (High Retention).*

## 5. The Financial Model: High LTV, Low Churn
Instead of making a small margin on *churning* therapists, we make a predictable margin on *sticky* partners.

*   **Unit Economics (Per Therapist):**
    *   **Revenue:** ~$2,500/mo (Cap) + ~$500/mo (Tech Upsells).
    *   **Cost:** ~$500/mo (Ad spend attribution + Admin share).
    *   **Profit:** ~$2,500/mo per partner.
*   **Scale Goal:**
    *   20 Partners = $50k/mo Profit ($600k/yr).
    *   50 Partners = $125k/mo Profit ($1.5M/yr).
*   **Plus Digital Product Upside:** Pure profit layer on top.

## 6. Risk Mitigation (The Red Team Findings)
*   **Regulatory (CRPO):** Fees must be strictly for **"Administrative & Facility Services,"** not referrals. Invoices must itemize Rent, Reception, Marketing, Software.
*   **Tax (CRA PSB):** Therapists must have **operational independence**. They set their own hours/fees. Contracts must be B2B. They ideally should bring their own laptop.
*   **Tech Liability (SaMD):** AI tools must be **"Administrative"** (Scribe, Intake) or **"Wellness/Education"** (Homework Tracker). We strictly avoid **"Clinical Decision Support"** (Diagnosis) to stay Class I Exempt.
*   **CAC Reality:** pSEO is a long-term asset. Launch requires Paid Ads. We structure a **"Managed Marketing Co-op"** where therapists pay the ad spend directly to protect our margin.

## 7. Unknowns & Next Steps (The "To-Solve" List)
We have validated the model. Now we need to validate the execution.

1.  **Legal Structure:** We need a specific **Cost-Sharing Agreement (CSA)** template that handles the "Cap" mechanics without looking like a salary.
2.  **Tech Build:** We need to build the MVP of the **"AI Scribe Wrapper"** (using Upheal/Tali API) to prove the "Vibe Coding" moat.
3.  **Recruitment:** We need to test the **"Grand Slam Offer"** script on 5-10 potential "Founding Partners" to gauge reaction.
4.  **Ad Co-op Logistics:** How do we technically manage individual ad budgets for 20 therapists without it becoming an admin nightmare?

**Status:** Ready to build the "Grand Slam Offer" Landing Page.
