Here is the synthesis of your feedback, blending the regulatory reality with the "vibe coding" opportunity.

### 1. The "Why Turn Down Money?" Question (The Math of Retention)

You asked: *"Once a therapist is giving us $3,000/month... why would we say 'Pay us $2,000'? We're turning down money."*

**The Answer: You are buying "Life Time Value" (LTV).**

Think of the therapist as the customer.
*   **Scenario A (The Greedy Split):** You keep charging 30%. At $15k/month revenue, the therapist pays you **$4,500/month**.
    *   *Therapist's Calculation:* "I can rent a room for $1,000 and pay Jane App $79. I am wasting $3,400/month staying here."
    *   *Result:* They leave at Month 18. They take their clients. Your revenue drops to $0. You have to spend money/time to recruit and ramp a new therapist (which takes 3-6 months).
*   **Scenario B (The Capped Partner):** You cap their fee at $2,500/month.
    *   *Therapist's Calculation:* "I'm paying a premium, but I get the pSEO leads, the admin, and the custom apps. It's not worth the headache to leave to save $1,000."
    *   *Result:* They stay for 5 years.
    *   **The Math:**
        *   Scenario A (18 months x $4,500) = **$81,000** Total Value.
        *   Scenario B (60 months x $2,500) = **$150,000** Total Value.

**Strategic Verdict:** You don't offer the cap on Day 1. You offer it as a "Partner Tier" unlock when they hit a certain volume. It is a **retention lock**, not an acquisition offer.

### 2. The "Incubator" Model (Your Unique Moat)

You asked: *"What do you think about... helping therapists build their own brands? Creating a network for therapists to create their own apps?"*

**This is the Billion-Dollar Insight.**

Most clinics try to *hide* their therapists' brands because they are afraid they will leave. You are proposing the **"Shopify for Therapists"** model:
*   **The Old Way (Clinic):** "You work for *Next Step*. You are a cog." -> Therapist leaves to be independent.
*   **Your Way (Incubator):** "We help you build *Your Brand*. We provide the pSEO infrastructure, the billing back-office, and the **Custom AI Tools** (built by your vibe coding) that you can't build yourself."

**Why this works with your "Vibe Coding" skill:**
*   If a therapist goes solo, they can buy Jane App. They *cannot* buy a custom "AI CBT Homework Generator" or a "Panic Attack Tracker" app that you built.
*   If you provide proprietary tech tools that improve *their* client outcomes, you have **Product-Led Retention**. They can't leave because they lose the apps.

### 3. The Final "Prompt 3" Strategy

We are ready to generate the final prompt. We will ask the model to build the **"Vertical Incubator Strategy."**

**The Core Pillars of this Strategy:**
1.  **Acquisition:** pSEO engine (your existing asset) drives leads at near-zero CAC.
2.  **Monetization:** "Graduated MSO" Model.
    *   Start: 70/30 Split (Standard).
    *   Unlock: Capped "Partner Fee" ($2,500/mo) at high volume to prevent churn.
3.  **Differentiation (The Moat):** The "Tech-Enabled Incubator."
    *   Therapists get a "Practice in a Box" (Billing, Intake, pSEO).
    *   **PLUS:** Access to your "Vibe Coded" library of clinical apps/tools.
    *   **PLUS:** You help them launch *their* niche courses (Revenue Share 50/50).

**Does this align with your vision?** If yes, I will construct the final prompt to get the detailed execution plan for *this specific model*.
