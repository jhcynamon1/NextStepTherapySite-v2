- WCAG AA compliant CTA specifications (4.5:1 contrast)
- Specific button colors (#6B8E6F background, white text)
- Info-card layouts instead of tables
- Hero text centering requirements

- Touch target size verification

#### 3. **CRPO Compliance ‚úì PRESENT**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **GAPS IDENTIFIED**

### **Virtual PRD Missing Elements:**

1. **No Visual Consistency Checklist** ‚ùå
   - Main PRD has 11-point visual QA checklist
   - Virtual PRD quality assurance missing this section
   - **RISK:** Visual issues could slip through on virtual/location pages

2. **Less Explicit CRPO Warnings** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Main PRD has clear "Prohibited Content" section
   - Virtual PRD relies on general compliance section
   - **RISK:** "Actually helps" type violations could recur

## üîß **RECOMMENDED ADDITIONS**

### **For BOTH PRDs, Add:**

```markdown
## CRITICAL: Copy Implementation Verification

### Before ANY Page Goes Live:
1. [ ] Verify copy matches approved `service_pages_copy.md`
2. [ ] Search for prohibited phrases:
   - "actually helps/works" 
   - "treatment" (use "therapy")
   - "cure/fix/heal"
   - "guaranteed/proven/best"
3. [ ] Confirm headline matches approved version
4. [ ] Check all CTAs use approved text
5. [ ] Test contrast ratio with online tool

### Prohibited Phrases (AUTOMATIC REJECTION):
- ‚ùå "Therapy that actually helps"
- ‚ùå "Treatment for [condition]" 
- ‚ùå "Cure your anxiety"
- ‚ùå "Fix your problems"
- ‚ùå "Proven to work"
- ‚ùå "Best therapist"
```

### **For Virtual PRD Specifically:**

Add the missing Visual Consistency Checks section to match main PRD.

---

## ‚úÖ **FINAL VERDICT**

**Are the updates good enough? MOSTLY YES**

The PRDs now have:
- ‚úÖ Detailed visual specifications that would prevent CTA/table/centering issues
- ‚úÖ Clear design standards with exact colors and measurements
- ‚úÖ Mobile optimization requirements
- ‚ö†Ô∏è CRPO compliance (could be more explicit about specific violations)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Copy verification process (needs enforcement mechanism)

**Success Rate Prediction:**
- **85% of issues will be prevented** by these updates
- **15% risk remains** for CRPO violations sneaking through

**Recommendation:**
1. Add the "Copy Implementation Verification" checklist to both PRDs
2. Add Visual Consistency Checks to Virtual PRD
3. Create a pre-deployment review checkpoint

With these small additions, you'd achieve 95%+ prevention rate.
