Because you're functional, you often don't get help until burnout forces the issue."

            <h2>What Is High-Functioning Anxiety?</h2>
            <p><strong>High-functioning anxiety is a clinical presentation of anxiety where external success masks internal distress—the person appears competent and accomplished while experiencing persistent worry, perfectionism, and exhaustion.</strong> Unlike visible anxiety that causes avoidance or withdrawal, high-functioning anxiety drives overachievement as a coping mechanism. Research suggests this pattern is particularly common among professionals in demanding fields where performance pressure is constant. Evidence-based treatment using Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) helps individuals separate their self-worth from productivity while maintaining their drive.</p>

        <p>High-functioning anxiety is often called the "Swan" effect. On the surface, you are gliding gracefully—hitting deadlines, organizing events, and being the rock for your family. But underneath the water, your feet are paddling frantically just to stay afloat.</p>
        <p>Because you are successful, people assume you are fine. You might even doubt yourself, thinking, <em>"I have a good job and a nice life. Why can't I just enjoy it?"</em></p>

        <!-- New Section: Neuroscience -->
        <h2>The Neuroscience of "Never Enough"</h2>
        <p>You aren't broken, and you aren't just "stressed." Your brain has simply become highly efficient at a specific survival mechanism.</p>
        <p>In high-performers, the brain's <strong>Default Mode Network (DMN)</strong>—the part responsible for daydreaming and self-reflection—often becomes hyperactive. Instead of resting when you aren't working, your brain automatically switches to "scanning for threats." In the modern world, threats aren't tigers; they are unopened emails, potential criticism, or the fear of being "found out" (Imposter Syndrome).</p>
        <p>This keeps your nervous system in a chronic state of <strong>sympathetic arousal</strong> (fight-or-flight). You perform well because you are running on cortisol, but cortisol is a short-term fuel. Long-term, it leads to burnout, irritability, and that crushing fatigue you feel at 5pm.</p>

        <h2>Why Standard "Coping" Doesn't Work</h2>
        <p>You've probably tried yoga, meditation apps, or "thinking positive." But for high-performers, these often become just another task to fail at.</p>
        <p>My approach is different. We don't try to delete your drive—that ambition is part of who you are. Instead, we use <strong>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)</strong> to untangle your self-worth from your productivity.</p>
        <p>We move from <em>"I need to do everything perfectly to be safe"</em> to <em>"I can pursue excellence without sacrificing my peace."</em></p>

                        <h3 class="faq-question">Is "High-Functioning Anxiety" a real diagnosis?</h3>
                        <p class="faq-answer">Here's what I've seen: it's not a formal diagnosis in the DSM-5, but it's a very real clinical presentation of anxiety. The difference is that instead of "freezing," your fight-or-flight response makes you "fight"—overwork, over-prepare, overachieve. Because you're functional, you often don't get help until burnout forces the issue. That's not a flaw in you; it's how the system works.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3 class="faq-question">How do you manage high-functioning anxiety?</h3>
                        <p class="faq-answer">We don't try to delete your drive—that ambition is part of who you are. That's not the problem. The problem is when your self-worth is fused to your productivity. We use ACT to untangle that. The goal isn't to stop achieving; it's to stop the internal panic that drives the achievement. You can pursue excellence without sacrificing your peace.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq-question">Will therapy make me lose my "edge" at work?</h3>
                        <p class="faq-answer">Here's what I've seen: the opposite happens. Anxiety is a dirty fuel—it burns hot and fast, but it damages the engine. We replace that with values-driven motivation. Most clients become <em>more</em> effective because they're not wasting mental energy on catastrophic thinking, <a href="/rumination-therapy.html">racing thoughts</a>, or second-guessing every email. The edge doesn't go away; it just stops cutting you.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq-question">Do you offer evening appointments?</h3>
                        <p class="faq-answer">Yes. I specifically reserve evening spots for professionals who can't leave work during the day. Virtual therapy across Ontario means no commute—you can transition from "work mode" to "therapy mode" without losing an hour to traffic or explaining your calendar to colleagues.</p>
