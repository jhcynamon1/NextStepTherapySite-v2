        <h2 class="section-title">Expert Support for Life's Major Transitions</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.1rem; color: var(--text-light); max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 3rem;">
            "Life threw me a curveball, and I didn't know where to turn." I hear this often from clients facing major transitions. After years of supporting people through career pivots, relationship changes, and unexpected life shifts, I've learned that transitions aren't just about the external changes—they're about rediscovering who you are in the midst of change. Whether you're an empty-nester in Oakville questioning your next chapter, a professional in downtown Toronto contemplating a career change, or someone anywhere in Ontario navigating relationship transitions, you don't have to figure it out alone.

                <p>Whether you're questioning your corporate role in Toronto's financial district, transitioning from the public sector, or considering entrepreneurship, career changes bring both opportunity and uncertainty. I help you explore what truly motivates you, navigate the Ontario job market, and plan your professional transition with confidence.

Beyond the logistics, relocations affect our sense of belonging and identity. I understand the unique aspects of Ontario communities and help you rebuild connections and find home in your new location.</p>

                <h3>Clarity Through Confusion</h3>
                <p>Transitions often feel overwhelming because there are too many options or no clear path forward.

We'll sort through the noise to find the direction that truly fits who you're becoming.</p>

I provide tools to navigate these emotional waves without being overwhelmed by them. You'll learn to be present with difficult feelings while still moving toward your goals.</p>

    <!-- FAQ Section -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How do I know if I need therapy for a life transition vs. just time to adjust?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">If you're feeling stuck, overwhelmed, or unable to make decisions about your transition after several weeks, therapy can help. Also consider therapy if the transition is affecting your sleep, relationships, work performance, or if you're using unhealthy coping strategies. Sometimes having professional support early in a transition actually shortens the adjustment period.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What's the difference between life coaching and therapy for transitions?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Therapy addresses both the emotional and practical aspects of transitions. While coaching focuses on goals and action steps, therapy also helps process grief, anxiety, identity questions, and past patterns that might interfere with moving forward. As a registered psychotherapist, I can address mental health concerns that often arise during major life changes.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Can you help if my transition was forced by circumstances beyond my control?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Absolutely. Unexpected job loss, divorce, illness, or other involuntary changes often bring additional layers of grief, anger, and helplessness. I help you process these difficult emotions while finding ways to reclaim some sense of control and direction. Often these forced transitions, while painful, can lead to unexpected growth and new opportunities.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How do you approach career transitions for people over 40 in Ontario?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Career changes later in life have unique considerations—financial responsibilities, family obligations, age discrimination concerns, and questions about starting over. I help you realistically assess your options while considering Ontario's employment landscape, potential retraining programs, and how to leverage your existing experience in new ways.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Do you help with transitions related to aging parents and caregiving?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Yes, this is increasingly common in Ontario as our population ages. I help adult children navigate the emotional complexity of watching parents decline, making difficult decisions about care, managing family dynamics around caregiving, and balancing your own life while supporting aging parents. This includes practical guidance about Ontario's healthcare and support systems.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How does online therapy work for life transitions support?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Online therapy is particularly effective for transition support because it's flexible and accessible during already stressful times. We use secure video platforms, and I can provide resources digitally. Many clients appreciate having sessions from home during vulnerable periods. I'm licensed to provide online therapy to anyone in Ontario, so location isn't a barrier.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What if I'm not sure what I want after my transition?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Not knowing what you want is completely normal and often the first thing we work on. Many people know what they don't want anymore but haven't figured out what they do want. Through values clarification, exploring your history of what's brought meaning and satisfaction, and experimenting with small changes, we gradually discover your direction together.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How long does therapy for life transitions typically take?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">It varies greatly depending on the complexity of your transition and what support you need. Some clients come for crisis support during acute transitions (6-10 sessions), others want ongoing support throughout a longer transition process (6 months to a year), and some use therapy intermittently as new challenges arise. We'll regularly check in about your goals and adjust as needed.</div>
