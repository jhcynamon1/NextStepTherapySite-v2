Whether the change was your choice or happened to you, the emotional aftermath can be overwhelming and confusing.</p>

                            <p>Everything you thought you knew about your life—your marriage, your career, your health, your future—suddenly feels uncertain. The rules you've lived by no longer seem to apply, and you're not sure how to move forward.</p>

Even positive changes—like promotions, marriages, or moving to dream locations—can trigger unexpected emotional responses because they challenge our existing sense of self and how we navigate the world.</p>

                            <p>Transitions often mean losing familiar routines, relationships, and roles that provided structure and meaning. Even when the change is positive, the loss of the familiar can create grief and disorientation.</p>

                            <p>When you change, your relationships often change too. Some people support your transition, others resist it, and some relationships may not survive the change. This social upheaval adds another layer of complexity to an already challenging time.</p>

                    <p class="section-intro">Therapy during life transitions is highly individualized because each person's situation and coping style is different. However, there are common elements that help most people navigate major changes more effectively.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Your First Sessions</h3>
                        <p>We begin by understanding your specific transition—what's changed, what's challenging, and what you're hoping to achieve through therapy. We also assess your current support systems and coping resources.</p>

                        <h4>We'll explore:</h4>
                        <ul class="feature-list">
                            <li>The specific changes you're facing and their emotional impact</li>
                            <li>What aspects of the transition feel most overwhelming or confusing</li>
                            <li>Your existing strengths and coping resources</li>
                            <li>What you've already tried and what's been helpful or unhelpful</li>
                            <li>Your hopes and concerns about your future</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Processing and Planning</h3>
                        <p>Each session balances emotional processing with practical planning. You need space to process the complex emotions that come with change, but also concrete strategies for moving forward.</p>

                        <h4>You'll work on:</h4>
                        <ul class="feature-list">
                            <li>Processing grief, anxiety, excitement, and other transition emotions</li>
                            <li>Developing decision-making frameworks for uncertain situations</li>
                            <li>Clarifying your values and priorities for this new phase of life</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3>Building Your New Chapter</h3>
                        <p>The ultimate goal isn't just surviving the transition—it's building a life that feels meaningful and sustainable in your new circumstances. This involves both practical planning and identity work.</p>

                        <h3>Why I Work with Life Transitions</h3>
                        <p>Life transitions are some of the most challenging and transformative experiences we face as humans. I'm drawn to this work because I've seen how the right support during times of change can help people not just survive transitions, but emerge stronger and more aligned with what truly matters to them.</p>

                        <h3>My Approach to Transition Support</h3>
                        <p>I don't believe in rushing people through change or minimizing the difficulty of transitions. Instead, I focus on building the skills and perspectives that help you navigate uncertainty with greater confidence and self-compassion.</p>

                    <p class="section-intro">Life transitions often involve practical complications—moving, traveling, scheduling challenges, or simply being too overwhelmed to add one more thing to your plate. Virtual therapy removes barriers while providing consistent support when you need it most.</p>

                            <p>When everything else in your life is changing, having consistent access to support becomes crucial. Virtual sessions ensure continuity even if you move, travel, or have schedule disruptions.</p>

                            <h4>"Should I wait until my situation is more settled before starting therapy?"</h4>
                            <p>Actually, the middle of a transition is often the best time to start therapy. You'll develop skills for navigating uncertainty and making decisions that serve you well throughout the transition and beyond. Waiting until things settle often means missing opportunities to shape your new circumstances.</p>

                            <h4>"How long does therapy for life transitions typically take?"</h4>
                            <p>This varies greatly depending on the transition and individual circumstances. Some people benefit from short-term support during acute transition periods (6-12 sessions), while others prefer longer-term support as they build their new life (several months to a year).</p>
