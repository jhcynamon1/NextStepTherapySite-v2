# Dofollow Backlink Outreach Plan - DR 3 → DR 20 in 90 Days
## nextsteptherapy.ca

**Goal:** Acquire 20 dofollow backlinks from DR 30-50 sites in 90 days
**Current State:** DR 3, 12 referring domains
**Target State:** DR 20, 30+ referring domains

---

## Why These Targets (Not Psychology Today/CRPO)

**Perplexity Research Findings:**
- ❌ Psychology Today: Uses `rel="nofollow"` (no SEO value)
- ❌ CRPO Directory: Uses `rel="nofollow"` (no SEO value)
- ✅ Health blogs, insurance directories, local business associations: Often dofollow

**Strategy:** Focus on sites that:
1. Provide dofollow links (pass PageRank)
2. Have DR 30-50 (strong but achievable)
3. Accept mental health provider submissions
4. Serve Ontario/Canadian audiences
