# Backlink Research: Therapy Directories - The Truth

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Research Question:** Do therapy directories like Psychology Today actually give dofollow backlinks that boost DR?

---

## üö® KEY FINDING: CONFLICTING INFORMATION

After researching, I found **contradictory claims** from different SEO sources. We need to verify this ourselves before spending money.

---

## What Different Sources Claim:

### Source 1: TherapySEO.com
**Claims Psychology Today, GoodTherapy, TherapyDen, Theravive = DOFOLLOW**

From their directory list article:
- ‚úÖ Psychology Today - dofollow
- ‚úÖ GoodTherapy - dofollow
- ‚úÖ TherapyDen - dofollow
- ‚úÖ Theravive - dofollow

### Source 2: GoodmanCreatives.com
**Claims most therapy directories are paid backlink opportunities BUT doesn't specify dofollow/nofollow**

### Source 3: Community Discussion (Psychlinks.ca - 500 error, couldn't load)
**Title suggests**: "Paying for Nofollow Links in Directories"
- This implies at least some directories use nofollow

### Source 4: Neil Patel
**Says**: "Should You Waste Time and Money on Nofollow Links?"
- Answer: Maybe? Nofollow links can still drive traffic and brand awareness
- But they DON'T pass link equity (no DR boost)

---

## The Critical Distinction:

### Dofollow Links:
- ‚úÖ Pass "link juice" / authority
- ‚úÖ Boost your Domain Rating (DR)
- ‚úÖ Help SEO rankings
- **This is what we want for DR 2.7 ‚Üí 15-20**

### Nofollow Links:
- ‚ùå Do NOT pass link authority
- ‚ùå Do NOT boost Domain Rating
- ‚ùå Do NOT directly help SEO
- ‚úÖ Can drive referral traffic
- ‚úÖ Can bring clients directly

**HTML difference:**
```html
<!-- DOFOLLOW (good for DR) -->
<a href="https://nextsteptherapy.ca">Next Step Therapy</a>

<!-- NOFOLLOW (no DR benefit) -->
<a href="https://nextsteptherapy.ca" rel="nofollow">Next Step Therapy</a>
```

## What We DON'T Know Yet:

1. **Does Psychology Today use dofollow or nofollow in 2025?**
   - Some sources say dofollow
   - Article title suggests some directories use nofollow
   - We haven't verified the actual HTML

2. **Does GoodTherapy use dofollow or nofollow?**
   - One source claimed it provides NO backlink at all
   - Another source says it's dofollow
   - Contradictory!

3. **What changed recently?**
   - Many directories switched from dofollow ‚Üí nofollow in recent years
   - Google cracked down on paid link schemes
   - Directories may have changed policies

---

## How to Verify (Action Items):

### Option 1: Check the HTML Ourselves
**Steps:**
1. Find an actual therapist profile on Psychology Today
2. Right-click their website link ‚Üí "Inspect Element"
3. Look for `rel="nofollow"` in the HTML
4. If no rel attribute = dofollow ‚úÖ
5. If rel="nofollow" = no DR benefit ‚ùå

**Do this for:**
- Psychology Today
- GoodTherapy
- TherapyDen
- Theravive

### Option 2: Ask Someone Who Already Has Listings
**Find a therapist who:**
- Has Psychology Today listing
- Check their Ahrefs/Moz backlink profile
- See if Psychology Today shows up as a backlink
- If it does = dofollow
- If it doesn't = nofollow

### Option 3: Run Our Own Test
**Method:**
1. Sign up for 1 month of Psychology Today ($30)
2. Add our website link
3. Wait 2 weeks
4. Check Ahrefs/Moz for new backlinks
5. If Psychology Today appears = dofollow
6. If it doesn't = nofollow, cancel subscription

## What We DO Know:

### 1. Directories Have Value Beyond Backlinks
Even if they're nofollow:
- ‚úÖ Direct client referrals (Psychology Today is #1 therapist finder)
- ‚úÖ Brand visibility
- ‚úÖ Trust signals (being listed on authoritative sites)
- ‚úÖ Referral traffic

**BUT:** This doesn't solve our DR 2.7 problem.

### 2. Free Directories Are Worth It Regardless
**No-brainer listings (free, even if nofollow):**
- CRPO directory (already a member)
- Yellow Pages Canada
- Yelp Canada
- Google Business Profile

**Why:** Zero cost, potential client referrals, no downside

### 3. Paid Directories = ROI Question
**If Psychology Today is dofollow:**
- $30/month = worth it for DR boost + referrals ‚úÖ

**If Psychology Today is nofollow:**
- $30/month = ONLY worth it if you get clients from it
- For DR boost? No, waste of money ‚ùå

## Decision Framework:

### IF Psychology Today is dofollow:
‚Üí Sign up for 1 month, test it, measure results

### IF Psychology Today is nofollow:
‚Üí DON'T pay for it for SEO purposes
‚Üí Only pay if you get direct client referrals

### For all other directories:
‚Üí Verify dofollow/nofollow BEFORE paying
‚Üí Focus on strategies we KNOW boost DR (guest posts, HARO, PR)

---

## Next Steps:

**Before our next conversation:**
1. [ ] Check Psychology Today HTML for rel="nofollow"
2. [ ] Check GoodTherapy HTML for rel="nofollow"
3. [ ] Check TherapyDen HTML for rel="nofollow"
4. [ ] Create list of free directories (guaranteed no downside)
5. [ ] Create list of proven DR-boosting strategies

**Then decide:**
- Which free directories to list on (do all of them)
- Whether paid directories are worth it (depends on dofollow status)
- What alternative strategies to prioritize (guest posts, HARO, PR)

---

## Key Insight:

**You were 100% right to question this.**

I made assumptions based on one SEO article that claimed these directories give dofollow backlinks, but:
1. Other sources contradict this
2. We haven't verified the actual HTML
3. Directories may have changed policies recently
4. Spending $120/month on something that might not boost DR is wasteful

**Better approach:**
1. Verify first (check HTML or run small test)
2. Focus on strategies with guaranteed DR impact (guest posts, HARO, PR)
3. Only pay for directories if they're proven dofollow OR if they bring clients

**This is exactly why you should always challenge assumptions in SEO.** Half the "advice" online is outdated or wrong.

---

**Status:** Research incomplete, need to verify before spending money.
**Action:** Check actual directory HTML or run $30 test with Psychology Today.
**Backup plan:** Focus on proven DR strategies (guest posts, HARO, .edu partnerships).
