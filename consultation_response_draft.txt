Subject: Re: Support for Your Child's University Transition Anxiety

Hi Jennifer,

Thank you for reaching out about your child's anxiety around starting university. This is such a significant transition, and it's completely understandable that they're experiencing intense anxiety - you're being a caring parent by seeking support during this time.

University transitions can be particularly challenging as they involve so many changes at once: new environment, independence, academic pressures, and social adjustments. The anxiety your child is experiencing is actually quite common, and there are effective approaches to help them navigate this successfully.

I'd love to learn more about your child's specific situation to better understand how I might be able to help. A few questions that would be helpful:

- What specific aspects of university are causing the most anxiety for them? (social situations, academic performance, being away from home, etc.)
- Have they experienced anxiety in other transition periods before?
- Are they starting university locally or moving away from home?
- What does "extreme anxiety" look like for them day-to-day?
- Have they tried any coping strategies or support so far?

I offer both in-person and virtual sessions, which can be particularly helpful for university students who may have varying schedules or be in different locations.

Would you prefer to discuss this over a brief phone call? I'm available for a 15-minute consultation call where we can talk through their situation and I can explain how therapy might help. You can reach me at [your phone number] or we can schedule something that works with your schedule.

Looking forward to hearing from you,
