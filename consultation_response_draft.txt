Subject: Re: Your Inquiry - Next Step Therapy

Hi Jennifer,

Thank you so much for reaching out - I know taking this first step to seek support for your child takes courage, and I'm honored that you're considering my practice.

University transitions can definitely be overwhelming, and you're absolutely not alone in this. Many families navigate similar challenges, and it's wonderful that you're being so proactive in supporting your child during this important time.

I'd be happy to learn more about how I might be able to help. To better understand your situation, I have a couple of quick questions:

Are you looking for support for yourself as a parent navigating this challenging time, or would your child be the one interested in therapy? And if it's for your child, are they open to the idea of working with someone, or is this something you're exploring on their behalf first?

Understanding who would be seeking support and their level of readiness helps me determine the best approach and whether I'd be a good fit for your family's needs.

Feel free to reply with just those basics, and we can take it from there.

Looking forward to connecting with you soon.

Warmly,

[Your name], RP
