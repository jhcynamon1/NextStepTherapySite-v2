## ‚úÖ STEP 2: Create Firecrawl Execution Plan (30 minutes)

### Based on Perplexity Results:

#### A. Extract Priority URLs:
From Perplexity's research, create a prioritized list:

**TIER 1: MUST SCRAPE (3-5 pages)**
Example format:
```
1. [URL] - Reason: Ranks #1 for "counselling ontario", 2,200 words, 15 FAQs
2. [URL] - Reason: Ranks #2 for "anxiety therapy burlington", Burlington-specific content
3. [URL] - Reason: Ranks #1 for "workplace stress ottawa", federal gov angle
...
```

**TIER 2: SHOULD SCRAPE (5-10 pages)**
```
6. [URL] - Reason: Ranks #3 for X, unique pattern Y
...
```

**TIER 3: NICE TO SCRAPE (10-15 pages)**
```
11. [URL] - Reason: Supplemental data for pattern validation
...
```

#### B. Define Extraction Goals:
For each URL to scrape, specify:
- **What to extract:** Full HTML? Schema only? FAQ questions? Internal links?
- **Why:** What pattern are we trying to identify?
- **How to use:** What will we change on our pages based on this?

  -d '{
    "url": "COMPETITOR_URL",
    "formats": ["markdown", "html"],
    "onlyMainContent": true
  }'
```
