### Step 2: AI Schema Generation with Claude
**Initial Prompt Template:**
```
I'm trying to write schema for my website [URL] and my goal is to rank number one in Google. Tell me which schemas I should implement into my site without writing any code.
```

**Follow-up for Code Generation:**
```
Write me an example of [schema type] that I can add to my site. Use script tags.
```

This is great. Now give me a template with placeholders so I can apply this to any [content type] on my website.
```

### Step 3: Implementation Methods
