                <p>"I can't even drive down Wonderland Road anymore without having a panic attack." This was how Sarah, a London client, described her anxiety when we first met. Living in London brings unique stressors—from navigating the chaos around Western University during student season, to dealing with endless construction on the 401, to managing the economic uncertainty that affects so many Southwestern Ontario communities.</p>

                <p>After working with hundreds of London area residents, I've learned that anxiety here isn't just about brain chemistry—it's about the daily realities of living in a mid-sized city trying to maintain its identity between Toronto's sprawl and Detroit's industrial legacy. Whether you're a Western student overwhelmed by academic pressure, a healthcare worker at Victoria Hospital dealing with burnout, or someone in Woodstock or St. Thomas feeling isolated from mental health resources, I understand the specific triggers that affect our community.</p>
