## Why This Role Matters

Your writing directly impacts our ability to hire 2-3 therapists and serve 30-40 more clients/month. If we hit 1,000 impressions/day (your blog posts are key), we prove market demand and scale the practice.

**Revenue math:** 1,000/day = $42,000/month = therapist hiring budget

Your $1,040/month cost generates 40:1 ROI if this works.
