# Product Requirements Document
## Virtual Therapy & Location-Specific Pages
### Next Step Therapy - January 2025

---

# 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## Project Scope
- **Create 10 virtual therapy pages** targeting online/remote keywords
- **Create 10 regional pages** for underserved Ontario markets
- **Create 10 combination pages** (virtual + location/demographic)
- **Total deliverable: 30 new optimized pages** leveraging virtual positioning

## Success Criteria

---

# 2. BRAND VOICE & TONE GUIDELINES
*[Identical to main PRD - maintaining consistency]*

## Core Voice Attributes
**Professional yet Approachable**
- Use "you" and "we" naturally
- Avoid clinical jargon
- Maintain professional boundaries
- Show genuine understanding

## Approved Language Examples

### ✅ USE THIS STYLE:
```
"Starting therapy from your own space changes everything. No rushing through 
traffic, no awkward waiting rooms. Just you, in your comfortable environment, 
ready to focus on what matters."
```

### ❌ AVOID THIS STYLE:
```
"Our teletherapy platform utilizes state-of-the-art video conferencing 
technology to deliver evidence-based therapeutic interventions remotely."
```

### CLIENT-APPROVED PHRASES (OK to use):
- ✅ "white-knuckle" (e.g., "You don't have to white-knuckle through anxiety")
- ✅ "Mindfulness Without the Woo-Woo" (specific section title)
- ✅ "3am wake-ups" (relatable reference)
- ✅ "mental health" (industry standard term, not promising healing)
- ✅ References to medication (when clarifying scope of practice)

### REJECTED PHRASES (Never use):
- ❌ "that actually work" or "that actually helps"
- ❌ "real people with real jobs" (too targeted)
- ❌ "revolutionary approach" (overpromise)
- ❌ LGBTQ+ specific branding (keep inclusive but not targeted)

## Virtual-Specific Framework

### Level 1: Convenience Recognition
Start with familiar virtual benefits:
- "Therapy that fits your actual schedule"
- "No commute means more time for you"
- "Privacy from your own space"

### Level 2: Technology Comfort
Address common concerns naturally:
- "As simple as a video call with a friend"
- "We handle the technical setup together"
- "Multiple backup options if tech fails"

### Level 3: Equal Effectiveness
Reinforce virtual validity:
- "The same therapeutic relationship, different medium"
- "Research shows virtual therapy works just as well"
- "Many clients prefer the comfort of home"
