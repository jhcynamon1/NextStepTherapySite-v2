Here are answers to concerns we hear most often from first-year students across Ontario.</p> <div class="faq-grid" data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs> <div class="faq-item" data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs> <h4 data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs>"Will my parents find out I'm going to therapy?"</h4> <p data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs>All therapy communications are strictly confidential, even if you're on your parents' insurance plan. Insurance companies receive basic information about services but not details about what you're working on. You control what information is shared with family members.</p> </div> <div class="faq-item" data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs> <h4 data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs>"How do I fit therapy into my busy schedule?"</h4> <p data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs">Virtual therapy offers maximum flexibility - you can attend sessions from your dorm room, a private space on campus, or anywhere with internet access. We can schedule around your class schedule, and sessions can be as frequent or infrequent as works for your needs and availability.</p> </div> <div class="faq-item" data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs> <h4 data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs>"Can therapy help with academic performance?"</h4> <p data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs">Absolutely. By addressing test anxiety, improving stress management, and developing healthy study habits, many students see improvements in their academic performance. We focus on building confidence and reducing the anxiety that can interfere with learning and test-taking.</p> </div> <div class="faq-item" data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs> <h4 data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs>"What if I can't afford therapy as a student?"</h4> <p data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs">Many students have insurance coverage through family plans or student health plans that cover psychotherapy. We provide official receipts for insurance reimbursement. During your free consultation, we can discuss your coverage and explore options to make therapy accessible.</p> </div> <div class="faq-item" data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs> <h4 data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs>"Is it normal to feel anxious during first year?"</h4> <p data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs">Extremely normal. Over 60% of first-year students experience significant anxiety during their transition to university. Starting post-secondary education involves multiple major life changes happening simultaneously, so feeling overwhelmed is a natural response.</p> </div> <div class="faq-item" data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs> <h4 data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs>"How is therapy different from talking to friends or family?"</h4> <p data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs">While friends and family provide valuable support, therapy offers professional training in evidence-based techniques for managing anxiety and stress. A therapist provides an objective perspective, specific tools for change, and a confidential space to explore concerns you might not feel comfortable discussing with people in your personal life.</p> </div> <div class="faq-item" data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs> <h4 data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs>"Can therapy help with homesickness?"</h4> <p data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs">Yes, therapy can be very helpful for homesickness. We work on strategies for staying connected with home while also building meaningful connections at university, managing the emotional ups and downs of being away from family, and developing confidence in your independence.</p> </div> <div class="faq-item" data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs> <h4 data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs>"What if I'm not sure what I want to study?"</h4> <p data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs">Academic uncertainty is common in first year. Therapy can help you explore your interests, values, and goals in a supportive environment. We can work through decision-making anxiety and help you approach academic choices with confidence rather than fear.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> <!-- Final CTA Section --> <section class="contact-section" id="contact" data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs> <div class="container" data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs> <div class="contact-content" data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs> <h2 data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs>Ready to Thrive in Your First Year?</h2> <p class="contact-lead" data-astro-cid-r3n23ggs>You don't have to struggle through university challenges alone.
