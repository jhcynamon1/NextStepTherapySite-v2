### PRD: Safely Correcting Canonicalization and Aligning Pages to V3 Standard

**1. Objective:**
To resolve all indexing errors and ensure every key landing page is fully compliant with the `LANDING_PAGE_PRODUCTION_PRD_V3.md` standard. This will be done with a meticulous, phased approach that prioritizes safety and transparency.

**2. Guiding Principles (Our Commitment):**
*   **V3 as the Gold Standard:** All work will be measured against the requirements in `LANDING_PAGE_PRODUCTION_PRD_V3.md`.
*   **Safety and Isolation:** We will continue with our "one change at a time" philosophy, with local verification and your approval before any deployment.
*   **Fix, then Enhance:** We will first fix the technical canonical issues and then immediately audit and enhance the page content and structure in the same step.

**3. The Revised Phased Rollout:**

**Phase 1: Fix and Enhance Location Pages**

*   **Action 1 (Technical Fix):**
    *   I will correct the canonical tag on all affected location pages (Toronto, Ottawa, etc.) to be self-referencing.
    *   Example: `.../toronto/depression-therapy` will have its canonical tag changed to point to itself.
*   **Action 2 (V3 Audit & Remediation):**
    *   For each of these location pages, I will perform a full audit against the V3 PRD checklist. This includes:
        *   **CRPO Compliance:** Verifying all language is process-focused and prohibited claims are removed.
        *   **SEO Optimization:** Checking for the minimal header, correct schema markup, H1 tags, meta descriptions, and a word count of at least 2,500.
        *   **Technical Requirements:** Ensuring correct contact info and GA4 tracking are present.
    *   I will make the necessary changes to bring each page into full compliance.
*   **Verification:** I will present a detailed report of the changes made to each page for your approval before deployment.

**Phase 2: Standardize and Enhance Remaining Pages**

*   **Action 1 (Technical Fix):**
    *   I will correct the `www` vs. non-`www` inconsistencies on the remaining pages identified in the audit.
*   **Action 2 (V3 Audit & Remediation):**
    *   Similarly, I will perform the full V3 audit on this second batch of pages and bring them up to standard.
*   **Verification:** This phase will also require a detailed report and your approval before deployment.
