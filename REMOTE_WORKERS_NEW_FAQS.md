## NEW FAQ #4: How long does therapy for remote work issues typically take?

The timeline varies significantly based on individual circumstances and goals. Some remote workers find practical strategies for boundaries and isolation within 4-6 sessions, while others prefer longer-term support as they navigate ongoing work-from-home challenges. We'll regularly check in about your progress and adjust the frequency of sessions based on what's working for you. There's no required minimum or maximum number of sessions.

## NEW FAQ #5: Can therapy help if I'm experiencing imposter syndrome while working remotely?

Imposter syndrome often intensifies in remote work environments because there's less informal feedback and more opportunity for comparison through social media. Therapy can help you examine the thoughts that fuel imposter feelings, develop more balanced self-assessment, and build confidence in your professional competence. ACT therapy approaches are particularly helpful for learning to act according to your values even when imposter thoughts are present, rather than waiting for the thoughts to disappear before taking action.

## NEW FAQ #6: What if I can't pinpoint what's wrong but remote work just feels harder lately?

This is actually very common. Many remote workers describe a vague sense that something feels "off" before they can articulate specific concerns. Therapy provides space to explore these nebulous feelings and often reveals patterns you hadn't noticedâ€”like gradual boundary erosion, accumulated social isolation, or unspoken resentment about work-life integration. Sometimes just having a structured conversation helps clarify what's been difficult.

---

## NEW FAQ #7: How do I know if my struggles are normal remote work adjustment or something requiring professional help?

If your challenges are affecting your sleep, relationships, job performance, or overall quality of life for more than a few weeks, that's a reasonable indicator that professional support could be helpful. You don't need to wait until things reach a crisis point. Early intervention often prevents more significant difficulties later. The free 15-minute consultation can help you determine whether therapy makes sense for your specific situation.

## NEW FAQ #8: Will my employer find out I'm in therapy?

No. Therapy is completely confidential. Your employer has no way of knowing unless you choose to tell them. If you're using extended health benefits for coverage, the insurance company knows you're seeing a mental health professional but doesn't receive details about what you discuss in sessions. The only information they receive is the date of service and the fee, not the content of your therapy.

---

## NEW FAQ #9: Can therapy help with Zoom fatigue and video call anxiety?

Yes, these are increasingly common concerns we address in therapy. Zoom fatigue often results from multiple factors: cognitive load from interpreting non-verbal cues on screen, self-consciousness about being on camera, and lack of natural breaks between interactions. Therapy can help you develop strategies for managing video call anxiety, setting boundaries around camera-on expectations, and building in recovery time between virtual interactions.

---

## NEW FAQ #10: What if my partner/family doesn't understand why remote work is stressful for me?

This is a frequent challenge for remote workers. People who don't work from home often misunderstand the unique stressorsâ€”they may think you have it easy because you avoid commuting, not recognizing the boundary challenges and isolation you experience. Therapy can help you develop communication strategies to explain your experience more effectively and, if appropriate, we can discuss involving your partner in a session to help them understand what you're navigating.

---

## NEW FAQ #11: Is it possible to do therapy during my lunch break without my colleagues knowing?

Absolutely. Many remote workers schedule therapy sessions during lunch hours from their home office or a private space. Virtual therapy is discreteâ€”it looks like any other video call on your calendar. You can label it generically ("Personal appointment" or "Health call") and take the session from wherever you have privacy. Sessions are typically 50 minutes, which fits within an extended lunch break.

---

## NEW FAQ #12: How does therapy differ from talking to friends about work stress?

Friends provide valuable support and validation, but therapy offers something different. A therapist has specialized training in understanding mental health patterns, can teach evidence-based strategies you wouldn't encounter in casual conversation, and provides a non-judgmental space where you don't need to reciprocate or worry about burdening someone. Therapy is also completely confidential, which allows for more honesty than you might feel comfortable with in personal relationships.

---

## NEW FAQ #13: What if I'm worried I'm overworking but my company culture expects constant availability?

This tension between personal boundaries and workplace expectations is one of the most common challenges remote workers face in therapy. We can work on developing strategies that protect your wellbeing while navigating realistic workplace constraints. This might include gradual boundary-setting experiments, communication approaches that feel authentic to you, and developing internal standards that aren't solely dependent on external validation from your employer.

---

## NEW FAQ #14: Can therapy help if I'm lonely working from home but also anxious about returning to office?

Yes, this paradox is remarkably common. You can simultaneously miss social connection while also feeling apprehensive about re-entering group work environments, particularly if you've developed social anxiety during extended isolation. Therapy can help you understand both sides of this experience, gradually rebuild comfort with social interaction if that's a goal, and develop a balanced approach to social connection that works for your temperament and circumstances.

---

## NEW FAQ #15: How do you handle it if I need to step away during a session for a work emergency?

Life happens, especially when working from home. If you need to briefly step away during a session for something urgent, that's understandableâ€”just let me know. If emergencies frequently interrupt your therapy time, we can problem-solve together about scheduling adjustments or boundary strategies. The therapy hour is your time, and protecting it from work intrusions can itself become part of the therapeutic work around boundaries.
