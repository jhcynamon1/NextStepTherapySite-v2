## 4. Initial Observations & Next Steps

*   **Content Overlap:** There is significant thematic overlap between several pages (e.g., `anxiety-counseling-ontario.html` and `services/anxiety-therapy.html`).
*   **Strong Templating:** The location-specific (`London`, `U of T`) pages follow a clear, effective template.
*   **Clear CTAs:** The calls-to-action are consistent and direct.

**Next Step:** This summary is now ready to be fed into Perplexity. The goal is to ask for specific, actionable recommendations on:
1.  How to **optimize** these existing pages to improve their rankings.
2.  Whether we should **duplicate and modify** the successful location-based template for other high-value cities (e.g., create a `therapist-ottawa.html`).
3.  How to handle the content overlap to avoid keyword cannibalization.
