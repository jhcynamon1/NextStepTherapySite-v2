Subject: Re: Your Inquiry - Next Step Therapy

Hi Jenny,

Thank you so much for sharing all of that detail with me - it really helps me understand what Naomi and your family are navigating right now. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of complex pieces, and I can hear how much you care about getting the right support for each of your children.

After reading through everything you've shared, I want to be completely honest with you. While I'm deeply moved by your family's situation, I don't think I would be the best fit for Naomi's specific needs. Her combination of autism spectrum traits, sensory processing needs, OCD elements, and the intensity of her current anxiety around this major transition really calls for someone with specialized experience in neurodivergent young adults and autism-informed therapy approaches.

What you're describing with Naomi - especially the stimming patterns and the overwhelm around university - suggests she would benefit most from a therapist who has specific training in working with autistic individuals and understands the unique challenges of post-secondary transitions for neurodivergent students.

Let me know if you'd like me to make some inquiries for you - I'm happy to help however I can.

Warmly,

Jesse
