              Anxiety therapy helps people change their relationship with constant worry, racing thoughts, and the tension that never fully releases. For Ajax residents balancing work demands, family responsibilities, and the daily commute, therapy offers practical tools to stop anxiety from running the show. Research shows 1 in 4 Canadians experience anxiety significant enough to affect their daily functioning.

              You wake up already thinking about what could go wrong today. The job, the bills, the kids, the house. Your mind cycles through problems before your feet hit the floor. By the time you're actually at work, you're already exhausted from the mental workout.

            <p class="text-lg text-navy/80 leading-relaxed">
              If any of that resonates, you're not weak or broken. You're dealing with something real. And there's a way to change your relationship with it.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-navy text-center mb-10">How Anxiety Therapy Actually Helps</h2>

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-navy/80">
          <p>
            Therapy isn't about fixing you. You're not broken. It's about understanding what's driving the anxiety and developing a different relationship with it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here's what I've seen: the anxiety usually makes sense. There are real pressures. Real responsibilities. Real reasons to worry about job security, finances, and family. The problem isn't that you care about these things. The problem is that the worry has taken over, and you've lost the ability to step back from it.
          </p>

          <p>
            I use Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), which has strong research support. But the specific approach matters less than whether we actually connect and whether our conversations help you see things differently.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy mt-8 mb-4">What we typically work on:</h3>

          <ul class="space-y-3">
            <li>Understanding why your anxiety shows up when and how it does</li>
            <li>Developing awareness without judgment (harder than it sounds)</li>
            <li>Getting clear on what you actually value, not just what you "should" do</li>
            <li>Building flexibility in how you respond to stress</li>
            <li>Learning to be present instead of always three steps ahead</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="mt-6">
            The goal isn't to eliminate anxiety. That's not realistic. The goal is to stop letting it run your life.

            I offer virtual therapy exclusively. For Ajax residents, this means you're not adding another appointment to your already full schedule. No driving to an office, no sitting in waiting rooms, no trying to squeeze something in between responsibilities.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sessions happen wherever you're comfortable. Your home after the kids are in bed. A quiet room during your lunch break. Wherever you can actually focus and be yourself.

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy mb-2">How quickly can I get an appointment?</h3>
            <p class="text-navy/70">
              Most clients get their first session within the same week. I know Durham Region waitlists can be months long. When you decide to reach out, you shouldn't have to wait.

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy mb-2">What type of therapy do you use for anxiety?</h3>
            <p class="text-navy/70">
              I use Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), an evidence-based approach. It's not about fighting anxiety. It's about changing your relationship with it so it stops running your life.

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy mb-2">Can you work around shift schedules?</h3>
            <p class="text-navy/70">
              Yes. I offer evening and weekend sessions specifically because I know many Durham Region residents work non-traditional hours. We'll find a time that works for your schedule.

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy mb-2">What if I've never done therapy before?</h3>
            <p class="text-navy/70">
              Most people I work with haven't. The first session is about getting to know each other. You don't need to have anything figured out. That's my job to help guide.
