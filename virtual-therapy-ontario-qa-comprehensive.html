                <h2>How effective is virtual therapy compared to in-person therapy in Ontario?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Virtual therapy is equally effective as in-person therapy for most mental health conditions.</strong> The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry published research showing 85% of clients report significant improvement with online therapy.</p>

                <p>A 2023 Ontario study found no statistical difference in outcomes between virtual and in-person sessions for:</p>
                <p><strong>• Anxiety:</strong> Cohen's d = 0.82 vs 0.79<br>
                <strong>• Depression:</strong> Cohen's d = 0.91 vs 0.88<br>
                <strong>• Trauma processing:</strong> Cohen's d = 0.76 vs 0.73</p>

                <p>Virtual sessions are particularly effective for anxiety disorders, depression, PTSD, adjustment disorders, relationship issues, and life transitions. The key factors for effectiveness are stable internet connection (minimum 5 Mbps), private therapeutic space, and strong therapeutic alliance - not physical location.</p>

        <div id="ohip-coverage" class="qa-section">
            <div class="question">
                <h2>Does OHIP cover virtual therapy sessions with registered psychotherapists in Ontario?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>OHIP does not cover virtual therapy sessions with registered psychotherapists (CRPO).</strong> However, most extended health benefit plans cover virtual therapy at the same rate as in-person sessions.</p>

                <p><strong>Typical coverage ranges:</strong></p>
                <p>• Group benefits: 80-100% up to $1000-$3000 annually<br>
                • Individual plans: 50-80% up to $500-$2000<br>
                • Union benefits: 100% up to $2500-$5000<br>
                • Government employee plans: 80-100% up to $2000-$4000</p>

                <p>Major insurers covering virtual therapy include Manulife, Sun Life, Great West Life, Blue Cross, Green Shield, Desjardins, and Industrial Alliance. Always verify coverage limits and pre-authorization requirements before booking.</p>

            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>CRPO (College of Registered Psychotherapists of Ontario) regulates virtual therapy under specific guidelines:</strong></p>

                <p>1) Therapist must be CRPO registered with current practicing certificate<br>
                2) Client must be physically located in Ontario during sessions<br>
