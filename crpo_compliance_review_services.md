## MINOR ADJUSTMENTS RECOMMENDED (OPTIONAL)

While the copy is compliant, these small adjustments could provide extra safety margin:

### Current → Suggested
1. "Therapy provides real tools for real relief" 
   → "Therapy provides practical tools to support your wellbeing"

2. "Things that work in real life"
   → "Strategies designed for real-life application"

3. "You'll learn techniques you can use immediately"
   → "We'll explore techniques you can practice right away"

**Note:** These changes are optional precautions, not compliance requirements.
