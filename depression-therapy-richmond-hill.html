        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-navy text-center mb-10">How Depression Therapy Actually Helps</h2>

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-navy/80">
          <p>
            Depression therapy isn't about forcing yourself to think positive thoughts. It's not about pretending to feel better or just talking about your problems without anything changing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here's what I've seen in my work with clients from Richmond Hill and across the GTA: depression usually has roots that make sense. Sometimes it's life circumstances. Sometimes it's accumulated stress and the weight of expectations. Sometimes it's a disconnect between how you're living and what you actually value. Understanding the roots doesn't make it disappear, but it helps us know where to focus.
          </p>

          <p>
            I use Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), which is an evidence-based approach that focuses on building a meaningful life even when difficult feelings are present. But the specific approach matters less than whether we actually connect and whether our conversations help you move forward.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy mt-8 mb-4">What we typically work on:</h3>

          <ul class="space-y-3">
            <li>Understanding what's contributing to how you're feeling</li>
            <li>Reconnecting with what actually matters to you</li>
            <li>Building small, sustainable changes that create momentum</li>
            <li>Developing a different relationship with difficult thoughts and feelings</li>
            <li>Finding ways to feel engaged with life again</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="mt-6">
            The goal isn't to feel happy all the time. That's not realistic. The goal is to feel connected to your life again, to have energy for the things that matter, to stop just going through the motions.

    <!-- Virtual Therapy Section -->

      <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-navy text-center mb-10">Virtual Therapy That Fits Your Life</h2>

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-navy/80">
          <p>
            I offer virtual therapy exclusively. For Richmond Hill residents, this means you're not adding another trip to your already full schedule. No driving to an office, no sitting in a waiting room, no fighting traffic on Highway 7 or the 404.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you're dealing with depression, even small barriers can feel impossible. Virtual therapy removes some of those barriers. You connect from wherever you're comfortable. Your home office. A quiet room after the house is quiet. Wherever you can actually focus.
          </p>

          <div class="bg-warm-white p-6 rounded-xl border border-sand my-8">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy mb-4">What virtual therapy looks like:</h3>
            <ul class="space-y-2">
              <li>Secure video sessions (similar to Zoom but healthcare-compliant)</li>
              <li>50-minute appointments</li>
              <li>Same-week availability for new clients</li>
              <li>Evening and weekend options available</li>
              <li>No software to download. Just click a link</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>
            I've been doing virtual therapy for years. For some clients, especially those dealing with depression, it actually works better than in-person. The energy required to show up is lower, and you're in your own space, which can make it easier to be open.
          </p>

          <p>
            Serving Richmond Hill and all areas including Oak Ridges, Mill Pond, Elgin Mills, Jefferson, Bayview Hill, and Langstaff. But honestly, location doesn't matter. If you're anywhere in Ontario, we can work together.

          When you're dealing with depression, just reaching out can feel like a lot. You don't need to have energy or motivation figured out before we start. That's part of what we work on together.

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy mb-2">How much does depression therapy cost in Richmond Hill?</h3>
            <p class="text-navy/70">
              Session rates are $175. I provide insurance receipts for all major Ontario insurance providers. Many Richmond Hill residents have coverage through employer benefit plans or private insurance that covers psychotherapy.

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy mb-2">Do you offer in-person therapy in Richmond Hill?</h3>
            <p class="text-navy/70">
              I offer virtual therapy exclusively, which works well for Richmond Hill residents whether you're at home in Oak Ridges, Mill Pond, or near Yonge Street. You connect from wherever you're comfortable, without adding to your schedule.

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy mb-2">How quickly can I get an appointment?</h3>
            <p class="text-navy/70">
              Most clients get their first session within the same week of reaching out. I know that reaching out for help with depression takes a lot. You shouldn't have to wait months after taking that step.

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy mb-2">What type of therapy do you use for depression?</h3>
            <p class="text-navy/70">
              I use Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and person-centred approaches. It's not about forcing positivity or just talking about your problems. It's about understanding what's happening and finding a way forward that works for you.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy mb-2">What if I'm not sure it's depression?</h3>
            <p class="text-navy/70">
              That's okay. You don't need a diagnosis to start therapy. If you're feeling stuck, low, disconnected, or like you're just going through the motions, that's enough. We figure out the rest together.

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy mb-2">What if I've never done therapy before?</h3>
            <p class="text-navy/70">
              Most people I work with haven't. The first session is really just about getting to know each other. You don't need to have anything figured out or know what to say. That's my job to help guide.
