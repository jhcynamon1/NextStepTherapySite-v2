        <h2 class="section-title">Professional Addiction Therapy in Toronto</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.1rem; color: var(--text-light); max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 3rem;">
            "I never thought I'd be the kind of person who needed addiction therapy." That's what Alex told me during our first session at my Toronto practice. They'd been managing their career in the financial district while hiding a growing dependence on alcohol that started as a way to cope with the city's relentless pressure. Addiction doesn't discriminate, and in Toronto's high-stress environment, it often develops as a misguided attempt to manage anxiety, depression, or overwhelming responsibilities. You're not broken—you're human.
        </p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Understanding Addiction</h2>
            <p>Addiction is a chronic condition characterized by compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli despite harmful consequences. It affects the brain's reward, motivation, and memory functions, making it difficult to stop without professional support.</p>

            <p>Signs of addiction may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inability to control or reduce use despite wanting to</li>
                <li>Continued use despite negative consequences</li>
                <li>Tolerance requiring increased amounts for the same effect</li>
                <li>Withdrawal symptoms when use is stopped</li>
                <li>Neglecting responsibilities, relationships, or self-care</li>
                <li>Unsuccessful attempts to quit or control use</li>
                <li>Spending significant time obtaining, using, or recovering from use</li>
                <li>Giving up important activities due to addiction</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Types of Addiction We Address</h3>

                <li><strong>Process Addictions:</strong> Work, sex, relationships, exercise</li>
