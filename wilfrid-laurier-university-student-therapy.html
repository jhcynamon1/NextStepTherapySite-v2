<!-- Intro Section -->
<section class="section">
<h2 class="section-title">The Laurier Experience Is Intense</h2>
<p>Laurier sells itself on community. The smaller campus, the school spirit, the tight-knit culture. What they don't mention is how that same intimacy creates its own pressure. When everyone knows everyone, the stakes for everything feel higher.</p>

<p>If you're in Lazaridis, you know exactly what I mean. The BBA program is one of the most competitive business programs in Canada. Co-op rankings matter. Case competitions matter. Club executive positions matter. Your LinkedIn profile is a competitive sport. And you're doing all of this while watching your peers -who sit beside you in every class -do the same things, often seemingly better.</p>

<p>The comparison is constant. Who got which co-op? Who made which club executive? Who's going to which networking event? In a program of 400 students who see each other daily, you can't escape it. And the business school culture often valorizes competition in ways that make admitting struggle feel like weakness.</p>

<p>But it's not just business students. Laurier's music program is notoriously demanding. Education students face their own pressures. And the smaller campus size means less anonymity -if you're struggling, people notice. That can be supportive, or it can feel suffocating.</p>
</section>

<!-- Why Private Therapy -->
<section class="section">
<h2 class="section-title">Why Laurier Students Choose Private Therapy</h2>
<p>The Wellness Centre at Laurier provides valuable support, especially for crisis situations. But many students find they need something different:</p>

<ul class="criteria-list">
<li><strong>Complete Anonymity:</strong> On a small campus where everyone knows everyone, privacy matters. Private therapy keeps your mental health completely separate from campus -no risk of running into classmates or professors in a waiting room.</li>
<li><strong>Beyond Session Limits:</strong> Campus counselling typically offers limited sessions. For ongoing challenges like anxiety, depression, or the sustained pressure of business school, that's often not enough.</li>
<li><strong>No Recruitment Season Waitlists:</strong> When stress peaks during co-op rankings or case competition season, campus services get overwhelmed. You need help when you need it, not weeks later.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding Business School Culture:</strong> I work specifically with students in competitive programs who face intense networking pressure, presentation anxiety, and imposter syndrome. You won't need to explain why LinkedIn optimization feels like survival.</li>
<li><strong>Continuity Through Co-op:</strong> Virtual therapy means the same therapist whether you're on campus or doing co-op in Toronto, Calgary, or anywhere else.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible Scheduling:</strong> Sessions between classes, during evenings, or before that 7 AM networking event. Your therapy fits your schedule.</li>
</ul>

<div style="background: #e8f5e9; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #c8e6c9;">
<p style="margin-bottom: 0; color: #2e7d32; font-weight: 500;"><strong>Cost Reality:</strong> The WLUSU Health Plan covers registered psychotherapists (CRPO), typically $500-1,000 per year. At $175/session, that's 3-6 sessions covered. If you're under 25, you may also be covered by a parent's benefits for additional sessions.</p>
</div>
</section>

<!-- Laurier-Specific Challenges -->
<section class="section">
<h2 class="section-title">Laurier-Specific Challenges We Address</h2>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #4a7c59;">Lazaridis School Pressure</h3>
<p>The Lazaridis School of Business and Economics is Laurier's flagship program. Getting in is competitive. Staying competitive once you're there is relentless. Co-op rankings determine your internships. Club positions determine your resume. Case competitions determine your reputation. And everyone around you is playing the same game.</p>

<p>The culture rewards hustle and punishes vulnerability. Admitting you're struggling feels like admitting you can't handle it -which feels like career suicide when your peers are your future competitors and colleagues. So you push through, networking with a smile while drowning internally.</p>

<p>Therapy provides a confidential space to process this pressure without professional consequences. We work on managing anxiety, developing authentic confidence (not just performed confidence), and finding sustainable approaches to achievement.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #4a7c59;">Small Campus Social Dynamics</h3>
<p>Laurier's size is marketed as a feature -tight-knit community, everyone knows each other, strong school spirit. And for some students, this is exactly what they wanted. But for others, the intimacy becomes claustrophobic.</p>

<p>When everyone knows everyone, there's nowhere to hide. Your dating life is campus gossip. Your failures are public knowledge. Your friend group overlaps with everyone else's friend group. The anonymity that allows reinvention at larger schools doesn't exist here.</p>

<p>This can be especially challenging if you're introverted, if you came from a diverse high school, or if you're questioning aspects of your identity. Therapy helps you navigate these dynamics, build authentic connections, and develop strategies for privacy in a goldfish-bowl environment.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #4a7c59;">The UWaterloo Comparison</h3>
<p>Laurier and UWaterloo share a city. Your campus is literally across the street from one of the most competitive tech schools in Canada. The comparison is unavoidable -and often unflattering.</p>

<p>Waterloo students talk about FAANG internships. Your co-op options feel less glamorous. Waterloo has name recognition that opens doors. You find yourself explaining what Laurier is. And the implicit hierarchy -Waterloo for the "smart" kids, Laurier for the "social" kids -grates even when you know it's oversimplified.</p>

<p>Many Laurier students carry chip-on-shoulder energy, constantly proving they belong. This can be motivating, but it's exhausting. Therapy helps you build identity and confidence independent of institutional comparisons.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #4a7c59;">Presentation and Performance Anxiety</h3>
<p>Business school means presentations. Lots of presentations. Case competition pitches, class presentations, interview presentations, networking elevator pitches. If you have any tendency toward performance anxiety, Lazaridis will find it.</p>

<p>The stakes feel impossibly high. A bad presentation affects your grade, your reputation, your team's perception of you, potentially your co-op ranking. And you're presenting to peers who are also your competitors -who may be looking for weaknesses to exploit.</p>

<p>Therapy provides evidence-based strategies for managing presentation anxiety, building genuine confidence, and separating your worth from your performance.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #4a7c59;">Music Program Pressure</h3>
<p>Laurier's music program is demanding in ways non-musicians don't understand. Daily practice hours, performance juries, theory courses, ensemble rehearsals -the workload is enormous. And unlike business school, the career path is uncertain. You're training for a field with limited positions and fierce competition.</p>

<p>Performance anxiety in music is visceral. Your instrument is your voice; criticism feels personal. And the small cohort size means intense relationships with peers and professors -no escaping dynamics that aren't working.</p>

<p>Therapy helps music students manage performance anxiety, develop sustainable practice habits, and process the identity questions that come with pursuing art as a career.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #4a7c59;">Identity Development in a Homogeneous Environment</h3>
<p>Laurier is less diverse than many Ontario universities. If you're a student of color, LGBTQ+, or otherwise different from the majority, the lack of representation can feel isolating. Finding community takes more effort. Microaggressions add up. And the small-campus dynamics mean less ability to curate your social environment.</p>

<p>Therapy provides space to process these experiences, develop strategies for self-advocacy, and maintain wellbeing in environments that weren't designed with you in mind.</p>

<!-- Insurance Info -->
<section class="section">
<h2 class="section-title">Insurance & Cost for Laurier Students</h2>
<p>Most full-time Laurier students are automatically enrolled in the Wilfrid Laurier University Students' Union (WLUSU) health insurance plan through StudentCare. This plan covers registered psychotherapists (CRPO), making therapy financially accessible.</p>

<ul class="criteria-list">
<li><strong>Undergraduates (WLUSU):</strong> Typically $500-1,000 per year for psychotherapy services</li>
<li><strong>Graduate Students:</strong> Coverage varies by program -check with your program office</li>
<li><strong>Receipts Provided:</strong> Same-day receipts for easy pay-and-claim reimbursement</li>
<li><strong>During Co-op:</strong> Your student insurance typically continues during work terms</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Under 25?</strong> You may also be covered by a parent's workplace benefits in addition to your student coverage. This can extend your therapy access significantly.</p>
</section>

<!-- Virtual Therapy Benefits -->
<section class="section">
<h2 class="section-title">Virtual Therapy That Fits Your Schedule</h2>
<p>Laurier students have packed schedules. Between classes, club meetings, networking events, case prep, and actually doing your coursework, finding time is hard. Virtual therapy provides flexibility that in-person services can't match:</p>

<ul class="criteria-list">
<li><strong>Attend From Anywhere:</strong> Your dorm, apartment, study room, or car -anywhere with privacy and internet</li>
<li><strong>No Campus Sightings:</strong> On a small campus, privacy matters. No one knows you're in therapy unless you tell them</li>
<li><strong>Evening and Weekend Options:</strong> Sessions when campus services are closed</li>
<li><strong>Co-op Continuity:</strong> Same therapist whether you're in Waterloo or doing co-op in Toronto, Vancouver, or anywhere else</li>
<li><strong>Fits Around Recruiting:</strong> Keep sessions during interview season without missing opportunities</li>
</ul>

<!-- FAQ Section -->
<section class="section">
<h2 class="section-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>How do I know if I need therapy?</h3>
<p>If stress is interfering with your grades, relationships, or wellbeing -that's beyond normal. Constant anxiety about rankings? Dreading presentations? Feeling disconnected despite being surrounded by people? These are signs that support could help.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Will anyone at Laurier know I'm in therapy?</h3>
<p>No. Private therapy is completely separate from the university. Nothing appears in any campus system. Your professors, peers, and future employers have no way of knowing unless you tell them.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Is seeking therapy a weakness in business school?</h3>
<p>The business school culture sometimes frames vulnerability as weakness. In reality, managing your mental health is strategic self-maintenance. Top performers across industries use therapy. The stigma is outdated -don't let it stop you from getting support you need.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Can therapy help with case competition anxiety?</h3>
<p>Yes. Case competitions trigger performance anxiety in predictable ways. We work on managing anxiety before and during presentations, building genuine confidence, and recovering from disappointing results without spiraling.</p>

<div class="faq-item">
<h3>How long does therapy take?</h3>
<p>It depends on your goals. Some students work through specific challenges (presentation anxiety, a tough semester) in 6-8 sessions. Others prefer ongoing support throughout their degree. No minimum commitment.</p>
