## 1. HERO BACKGROUND IMAGE

### Purpose: 
Subtle background that doesn't compete with your strong headline "You Don't Have to Navigate This Alone"

### Refined Prompt for Site Match:
```
Minimalist abstract watercolor artwork, very light and airy, 1920x1080px, 16:9 ratio.
Soft organic shapes in extremely pale sage green (#8FA68E at 15% opacity) flowing
horizontally across white background. The shapes should be cloud-like or smoke-like,
very ethereal and barely there. Add tiny hints of soft blue (#6B9BD1 at 10% opacity)
in 2-3 small areas. The overall effect should be 90% white space with just subtle
color suggestions. No hard edges anywhere - everything soft and diffused. The shapes
should be positioned to leave clear space in center-left area for text overlay.
Style: Minimal Scandinavian watercolor meets modern web design. Think of morning
mist or very diluted ink in water. The image should enhance not dominate. Perfect
for a clean, professional therapy website. No objects, no scenery, just abstract
gentle color washes. Export with white background, not transparent.
```

## 2. SERVICE CARD BACKGROUNDS

Your site has 6 service cards. These need subtle, abstract backgrounds that work with text overlay.

### Universal Service Card Template:
```
Square format 400x400px, minimalist geometric design with organic touches.
Create abstract icon-style illustration with 85% white space. Use single accent
color at 20-30% opacity creating simple shape in center. Very soft drop shadow
(2px blur, 10% opacity). Design should be centered with generous padding.
Background: pure white (#FFFFFF). Style: Modern icon design meets wellness
brand, extremely minimal, professional but warm. Think Apple's simplicity
meets therapy warmth. No realistic objects, only abstract representations.
```

### 2.1 Anxiety & Stress (Sage Green Focus):
```
[Use template above] Central element: Three overlapping circles in different
sizes, sage green (#8FA68E) at 25% opacity, creating a Venn diagram effect.
The overlaps create slightly darker areas. One circle has subtle radial gradient
from center. Represents finding calm and order. Add one tiny gold dot (#D4A574)
at intersection point. Total colored area should not exceed 30% of image.
```

### 2.2 Men's Mental Health (Navy Blue Focus):
```
[Use template above] Central element: Single strong triangle with one corner
softly rounded, navy blue (#1e3e72) at 20% opacity. Small sage green circle
(#8FA68E at 15% opacity) partially emerging from the rounded corner. Represents
strength with flexibility. Clean, minimal, architectural feel. No stereotypes.
```

### 2.3 Workplace Stress (Balanced Colors):
```
[Use template above] Central element: Abstract representation of balance - 
horizontal line with two circles above and below, creating abstract scale.
Use sage green (#8FA68E) at 25% opacity for line and one circle, soft blue
(#6B9BD1) at 20% for other circle. Slight tilt suggesting finding balance.
Extremely minimal and clean.
```

### 2.4 Life Transitions (Gradient):
```
[Use template above] Central element: Single curved arrow or path made of
dots, transitioning from grey (#6C757D at 20% opacity) to sage green
(#8FA68E at 25% opacity). The dots get progressively larger and more opaque.
Suggests movement and change. Very subtle, mostly white space.
```

### 2.5 Depression & Mood (Hope Symbol):
```
[Use template above] Central element: Abstract sun/sunrise - just the top
half of a circle with 5-6 very thin lines radiating upward. Start with
grey (#6C757D at 15% opacity) at bottom, gradient to warm gold (#D4A574
at 20% opacity) at tips of rays. Minimal, suggesting hope without being
overly cheerful.
```

### 2.6 Relationships (Connection):
```
[Use template above] Central element: Two speech bubbles overlapping by 30%,
one sage green (#8FA68E at 20% opacity), one soft blue (#6B9BD1 at 20% opacity).
Where they overlap, slight color blend. Bubbles are rounded rectangles, not
traditional speech bubble shape. Modern, minimal, clean.
```

## 3. ABOUT SECTION BACKGROUND

### Purpose: 
Very subtle texture behind your therapist information

### Refined Prompt:
```
Abstract background texture, 1920x400px, extremely subtle and professional.
Create a barely-visible organic pattern using sage green (#8FA68E) at 5% opacity
maximum. Pattern should be natural/organic - think very faint leaf veins, or
subtle topographical lines, or extremely light marble veining. The pattern
should be so subtle it's almost subliminal - viewers should feel it more than
see it. 95% white, 5% pattern. No focal points, even distribution. This should
add just a hint of texture without interfering with text readability. Style:
Premium stationery watermark meets modern web design. Export as PNG with white
background.
```

---

## 4. PROCESS SECTION ICONS

Your site shows 4 steps. These need clean, simple icons.

### Process Icon Template:
```
Circle format 200x200px, line art style illustration, 2px stroke weight.
Use sage green (#8FA68E) for all lines. White background with very subtle
circular border in light grey (#F8F9FA). Icon should be centered with 25%
padding on all sides. Style: Modern line icons, professional, clean.
Similar to Feather Icons or Heroicons outline style.
```

### 4.1 Initial Connection (Coffee/Chat):
```
[Use template above] Two simple coffee cups viewed from above, slightly
overlapping. Minimal detail - just circular shapes with small handles.
Add 2-3 curved lines above suggesting steam. Geometric, clean, symmetrical.
```

### 4.2 Getting Full Picture (Compass/Map):
```
[Use template above] Simple compass rose or abstract map pin. Four lines
creating compass points, small circle in center. Or alternative: three
connected dots forming a triangle, suggesting mapping/understanding.
```

### 4.3 Building Toolkit (Tools):
```
[Use template above] Three simple geometric shapes representing tools -
square, circle, triangle arranged in balanced composition. Or alternative:
Simple briefcase outline with one shape visible inside.
```

### 4.4 Real Change (Growth):
```
[Use template above] Abstract plant with 3 leaves on simple stem, very
geometric and stylized. Or alternative: Upward trending line with 3 dots
marking progress points.
```

## 5. TESTIMONIAL/TRUST SECTION BACKGROUND

### Purpose:
Subtle background for trust indicators

### Refined Prompt:
```
Soft gradient background, 1920x300px, very subtle and professional.
Linear gradient from pure white (#FFFFFF) at top to 3% sage green
(#8FA68E at 97% transparency) at bottom. Add very subtle noise texture
at 2% opacity to prevent banding. No other elements, just the cleanest
possible gradient. This should be barely perceptible, just enough to
create visual separation. Export as PNG or CSS gradient code.
```

---

## 6. FOOTER TEXTURE

### Purpose:
Minimal texture for footer area

### Refined Prompt:
```
Subtle geometric pattern, 1920x400px, for dark footer background.
Create repeating pattern of small dots or thin lines in white at 5% opacity
over dark grey (#343A40) background. Pattern should be regular but not
distracting - think subtle halftone or very fine diagonal lines at 45 degrees.
The texture should add just enough visual interest without competing with
footer text. Style: Modern minimal texture, premium website footer.
```

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

1. **Test backgrounds with text** - Ensure all backgrounds work with your dark grey text
2. **Maintain consistency** - All images should feel like a family
3. **Optimize for speed** - Keep file sizes minimal (use SVG where possible)
4. **Consider dark mode** - These designs can be inverted for future dark mode

The goal is images that ENHANCE your clean design, not compete with it. Think of them as subtle design elements that add polish without distraction.
