- Avoid clinical jargon
- Maintain professional boundaries
- Show genuine understanding

## Approved Language Examples

### ✅ USE THIS STYLE:
```
"You know that feeling when your chest gets tight for no apparent reason? 
We understand. Anxiety has a way of showing up uninvited, especially when 
you're already dealing with life's pressures."
```

### ❌ AVOID THIS STYLE:
```
"Professional anxiety therapy utilizing evidence-based modalities for 
optimal therapeutic outcomes in clinical populations."
```

## Emotional Connection Framework

### Level 1: Recognition
Start with familiar scenarios:
- "That Sunday night feeling before Monday"
- "When your mind won't stop replaying conversations"
- "The exhaustion that sleep doesn't fix"

### Level 2: Validation  
Acknowledge without dramatizing:
- "This is more common than you might think"
- "You're not alone in feeling this way"
- "Many professionals experience this"

### Level 3: Hope
Offer realistic optimism:
- "Change is possible with the right support"
- "Small steps can lead to significant improvement"
- "You don't have to figure this out alone"

## Forbidden Phrases
- ❌ "White-knuckle through"
