            </div>

            <div class="disclaimer-box">
                <strong>Important Medical Disclaimer:</strong><br>
                I am a Registered Psychotherapist, not a psychologist or psychiatrist. I do not provide formal ADHD diagnoses or prescribe medication. This article is for educational purposes to help you understand your symptoms. If you suspect you have ADHD, I can support you in managing the associated anxiety and burnout, and help guide you toward the right professionals for a formal assessment.
            </div>

            <p>You look successful on paper. You hit your deadlines (mostly), you show up to meetings, and you keep the wheels turning. But inside, you feel like you're constantly scrambling.</p>
            
            <p>You sit down to work, and your brain feels like a browser with 50 tabs open. You lose hours to scrolling or "busy work," only to panic at 4 PM and hyper-focus to get the real work done.</p>

            <p>You've probably asked yourself (or Google): <em>"Do I have adult ADHD?"</em></p>

            <p>It's a valid question. But for many high-performing professionals, the answer isn't always ADHD. Often, it's a nervous system on fire—what we often call <strong>High-Functioning Anxiety</strong>.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>The Shared Symptoms</h3>
                <p>On the surface, unmanaged ADHD and high-functioning anxiety look almost identical. Both can cause:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Procrastination:</strong> Putting things off until the last minute.</li>
                    <li><strong>Brain Fog:</strong> Feeling unable to think clearly or prioritize.</li>
                    <li><strong>Irritability:</strong> Snapping at partners or colleagues when interrupted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Restlessness:</strong> An inability to just "sit still" and relax.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>The Key Difference: The "Why" Behind the Behavior</h2>
            <p>While the <em>behaviors</em> look the same, the <em>internal driver</em> is usually different. Understanding this distinction is the first step to getting the right support.</p>

            <h3>1. The Experience of ADHD (Executive Function)</h3>
            <p>With ADHD, the struggle is often about <strong>initiation and regulation</strong>. It’s an issue with the brain's executive functions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Thought:</strong> "I want to do this task, I know I need to do it, but I literally cannot make my body start."</li>
                <li><strong>The Feeling:</strong> A sense of paralysis or "under-stimulation." You might need high pressure (deadline adrenaline) just to turn your brain on.</li>
                <li><strong>The Focus:</strong> Once you break through, you might hyper-focus on the wrong things (like reorganizing your email folders instead of writing the report).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. The Experience of Anxiety (Fear & Safety)</h3>
            <p>With High-Functioning Anxiety, the struggle is often about <strong>perfectionism and fear</strong>. Your nervous system perceives the task as a "threat."</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Thought:</strong> "I want to do this, but what if it's not good enough? What if I mess up? I need to figure out the perfect plan before I start."</li>
                <li><strong>The Feeling:</strong> A physical tightness in the chest, racing heart, or a buzz of "doom." You avoid the task to avoid the <em>feeling</em> of anxiety.</li>
                <li><strong>The Focus:</strong> You are distracted because your brain is scanning for threats (checking emails, worrying about a comment your boss made) rather than focusing on deep work.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The "Burnout" Mimic</h2>
            <p>There is a third player in this equation: <strong>Burnout</strong>.</p>
            <p>When you have been running on high-octane stress for years (common in law, tech, and finance), your frontal cortex—the part of the brain responsible for focus—starts to go offline. This is a survival mechanism.</p>
            <p><strong>Chronic stress can create "acquired ADHD-like symptoms."</strong> Your sleep suffers, your memory slips, and your ability to concentrate evaporates. You haven't suddenly "developed" ADHD in your 30s; your battery is just empty.</p>

            <h2>How Therapy Helps (Without a Diagnosis)</h2>
            <p>You don't need a label to start feeling better. In fact, waiting for a diagnosis can sometimes delay the relief you need right now.</p>
            <p>In therapy, we focus on <strong>calming the nervous system first</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>If your focus issues are driven by anxiety or burnout, regulating your stress response will often bring your focus back online. We work on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Uncoupling productivity from self-worth:</strong> Learning that you are safe even if you aren't "doing" 24/7.</li>
                <li><strong>Taming the Inner Critic:</strong> reducing the perfectionism that causes procrastination.</li>
                <li><strong>Nervous System Regulation:</strong> Practical tools to move you from "Fight or Flight" back to "Rest and Digest."</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>What if it really is ADHD?</strong></p>
            <p>If we reduce the anxiety and the focus issues persist, that gives us clarity. You now have a much clearer path to take to a psychologist or doctor for a formal assessment. And even with an ADHD diagnosis, therapy remains a crucial tool for managing the emotional regulation and "shame spirals" that often come with neurodivergence.</p>

                <h3>Stop Guessing and Start Healing</h3>
                <p>Whether it's a wiring issue or a wiring <em>overload</em>, you deserve to feel calm and capable again. You don't have to navigate this alone.</p>
