            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>Important Medical Disclaimer:</strong> I am a Registered Psychotherapist, not a Psychologist or Psychiatrist. <strong>I do not diagnose ADHD.</strong></p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">This article explores the <em>subjective experience</em> of focus and anxiety. It is for educational purposes only and is not a substitute for a formal medical assessment. If you suspect you have ADHD, I encourage you to speak with your family doctor or a psychologist for a diagnosis. Therapy can support the <em>symptoms</em> of stress and emotional regulation regardless of the diagnosis.</p>
            </div>

            <p>You’re successful on paper. You hit your targets, you show up to meetings, and you get the job done. But inside, you feel like you’re constantly scrambling.</p>
            <p>You sit down to work, and your brain feels like a browser with 50 tabs open. You pick up your phone, check email, stare at the wall, and suddenly it’s 2 PM and you haven’t started the "big task."</p>
            <p>Is it undiagnosed Adult ADHD? Or is it High-Functioning Anxiety?</p>
            <p>The symptoms often look identical from the outside: <strong>procrastination, brain fog, irritability, and exhaustion.</strong> But the <em>internal driver</em> is often very different.</p>

            <h2>The Internal Experience: "I Can't Start" vs. "I'm Scared to Start"</h2>
            
            <p>In my practice with high-performing professionals in Ontario, I often see clients who are convinced they have ADHD because they can't focus. Sometimes they do. But often, what looks like an attention deficit is actually a nervous system in a state of chronic threat.</p>

            <p>Here is how the internal monologue often differs:</p>

            <table class="comparison-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>The Symptom</th>
                        <th>The ADHD Experience (Executive Function)</th>
                        <th>The Anxiety Experience (Emotional Regulation)</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Procrastination</strong></td>
                        <td>"I want to do it, but I physically can't make myself start. My brain keeps sliding off the task."</td>
                        <td>"I want to do it, but I'm terrified it won't be perfect, so I'm avoiding the feeling of potential failure."</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Distraction</strong></td>
                        <td>"Oh, look at that bird! I wonder what kind it is. I should Google that. Wait, what was I doing?"</td>
                        <td>"What if I get fired? Did I send that email? I need to check Slack again to make sure I'm safe."</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Exhaustion</strong></td>
                        <td>Drained from the effort of trying to organize a chaotic brain.</td>
                        <td>Drained from the physical tension of being in "fight-or-flight" mode all day.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h2>The "Burnout Mimic"</h2>
            <p>There is a third player in this game: <strong>Burnout.</strong></p>
            <p>When you have been running on high-functioning anxiety for years—white-knuckling through your career—your nervous system eventually hits a wall. This is often when clients call me saying, "I think I developed ADHD."</p>
            <p>Chronic stress damages the prefrontal cortex—the part of your brain responsible for focus and planning. <strong>A burnt-out brain looks almost exactly like an ADHD brain.</strong> You become forgetful, scattered, and emotionally reactive.</p>

            <h2>How Therapy Helps (Without a Diagnosis)</h2>
            <p>Whether you have a neurodevelopmental condition (ADHD) or an emotional regulation issue (Anxiety), the result is the same: <strong>You are suffering, and you can't work the way you want to.</strong></p>
            <p>Therapy isn't about slapping a label on you; it's about calming the system.</p>

            <h3>1. We Calm the Physiology</h3>
            <p>We use techniques to down-regulate your nervous system. If your brain is in "survival mode," it <em>cannot</em> focus on a spreadsheet. It is scanning for tigers. By lowering your baseline stress, we often see focus return naturally.</p>

            <h3>2. The "Process of Elimination"</h3>
            <p>Think of therapy as a diagnostic experiment. If we treat the anxiety and the focus issues disappear, it was likely anxiety. If we treat the anxiety and you feel calmer <em>but still cannot organize your thoughts</em>, that gives us valuable data to take to a psychologist for a formal ADHD assessment.</p>

            <h3>3. Practical Skills for Regulation</h3>
            <p>We work on "unhooking" from the perfectionism and fear that drives procrastination. We build routines that support a tired brain, rather than beating it into submission.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>You Don't Need a Label to Deserve Support</h3>
                <p>You don't need to wait for a formal diagnosis to start feeling better. If you are struggling to manage your workload and your wellbeing, therapy can help you untangle the knot.</p>
