## INTERNAL LINKING STRATEGY

**Every blog post must link to:**
1. One service page (anxiety-treatment-toronto.html, virtual-therapy-ontario.html, etc.)
2. One related blog post (content clustering)
3. Homepage or contact page (conversion path)

**Strengthen these key hubs:**
- failing-university-anxiety.html (already Page 1)
- homesick-university.html (18.75% CTR winner)
- first-year-university-anxiety.html (Page 1 potential)
- mens-therapy-toronto.html (new high-value page)
- virtual-therapy-ontario.html (needs rescue from Position #86)

## CONTENT PRODUCTION NOTES

**Copywriter must deliver:**
- 2,000-3,000 words per post
- FAQPage schema compatible Q&A section (3-5 questions)
- 5-7 H2 subheadings with keywords
- 3-5 H3 subheadings for long-tail terms
- CRPO compliant language (no comparative claims, guarantees)
- Author byline: "By Jesse Cynamon, RP (CRPO #10979)"
- Internal links (minimum 3 per post)

**Jesse review process:**
- Posts delivered every Friday
- Review by Monday
- Publish by Wednesday
- Track performance by Friday (7-day check-in)

## BUDGET BREAKDOWN

**Weeks 1-12:** 4 posts/week @ $60 = $240/week × 12 = $2,880
**Weeks 13-17:** 5 posts/week @ $60 = $300/week × 5 = $1,500
**Weeks 18-26:** 6 posts/week @ $60 = $360/week × 9 = $3,240

**Total 6-month investment:** $7,620

**Expected ROI Month 6:** $42,000/month = 5.5x return

**Break-even:** Week 3 (if conversion rate holds)

---

## RISK MITIGATION

**If behind target by Month 3:**
- Increase posting frequency to 6/week immediately
- Add 10-15 city pages (quick wins)
- Hire second copywriter for acceleration

**If ahead of target by Month 4:**
- Maintain 4 posts/week (reduce cost)
- Focus on conversion optimization
- Begin hiring therapist recruitment

**If city pages fail (pSEO doesn't work):**
- Abandon city strategy
- Double down on university + workplace clusters
- Add 2-3 posts/week in existing winners
