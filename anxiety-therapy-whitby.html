              Anxiety therapy helps people change their relationship with worry, overthinking, and constant tension. For Whitby residents dealing with the stress of long commutes, work pressure, and the demands of daily life, therapy offers tools to stop anxiety from running the show. Research shows that 1 in 4 Canadians experience anxiety significant enough to affect their daily functioning.

      <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-navy text-center mb-10">How Anxiety Therapy Actually Helps</h2>

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-navy/80">
          <p>
            Therapy isn't about fixing you. You're not broken. It's about understanding what's driving the anxiety and developing a different relationship with it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here's what I've seen working with clients from Durham Region: the anxiety usually makes sense. There are real pressures. Real responsibilities. The commute, the job, the family, the cost of living. The problem isn't that you worry. The problem is that the worry has taken over, and you've lost the ability to step back from it.
          </p>

          <p>
            I use Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), which has strong research support. But the specific approach matters less than whether we actually connect and whether our conversations help you see things differently. ACT-based therapy shows 60-80% improvement rates within 12-16 sessions (peer-reviewed research).
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy mt-8 mb-4">What we typically work on:</h3>

          <ul class="space-y-3">
            <li>Understanding why your anxiety shows up when and how it does</li>
            <li>Developing awareness without judgment (harder than it sounds)</li>
            <li>Getting clear on what you actually value, not just what you "should" do</li>
            <li>Building flexibility in how you respond to stress</li>
            <li>Learning to be present instead of always three steps ahead</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="mt-6">
            The goal isn't to eliminate anxiety. That's not realistic. The goal is to stop letting it run your life.

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy mb-2">How quickly can I get an appointment?</h3>
            <p class="text-navy/70">
              Most clients get their first session within the same week. I know Durham Region waitlists can be months long. When you decide to reach out, you shouldn't have to wait.

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy mb-2">What type of therapy do you use for anxiety?</h3>
            <p class="text-navy/70">
              I use Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), an evidence-based approach. It's not about fighting anxiety. It's about changing your relationship with it so it stops running your life.

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy mb-2">Can therapy help with commuter stress?</h3>
            <p class="text-navy/70">
              Absolutely. Many of my Durham Region clients deal with the specific stress of long GO Train commutes and work pressure in Toronto. We work on that directly.

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy mb-2">What if I've never done therapy before?</h3>
            <p class="text-navy/70">
              Most people I work with haven't. The first session is about getting to know each other. You don't need to have anything figured out. That's my job to help guide.
