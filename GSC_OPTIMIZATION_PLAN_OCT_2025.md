## Priority 1: Fix Burlington Keyword Cannibalization

### The Problem

**5 pages competing for Burlington keywords**:
| URL | Impressions | Position | Status |
|-----|------------|----------|--------|
| virtual-therapy-burlington.html | 812 | 33.71 | ❌ Cannibalizing |
| burlington-online-therapy | 234 | 27.03 | ✅ Keep as canonical |
| burlington-online-therapy.html | 204 | 34.25 | ❌ Cannibalizing |
| online-therapy-burlington.html | 150 | 44.27 | ✅ Already redirected |
| online-therapy-burlington | 134 | 41.06 | ❌ Cannibalizing |

**Total wasted impressions**: 2,173/month split across 5 pages

### The Solution

**Consolidate to ONE canonical page**: `burlington-online-therapy.html`

**Why this one?**
- Just rebuilt with full VCC structure (2,100+ words)
- Best URL structure (city-service pattern)
- Already has 755 query impressions for "online therapy burlington"

**301 Redirects to Add**:
```json
// Add to vercel.json
{ "source": "/virtual-therapy-burlington.html", "destination": "/burlington-online-therapy.html", "permanent": true },
{ "source": "/virtual-therapy-burlington", "destination": "/burlington-online-therapy.html", "permanent": true },
{ "source": "/burlington-online-therapy", "destination": "/burlington-online-therapy.html", "permanent": true }
```

**Note**: `/online-therapy-burlington.html` already redirects ✅

### Expected Impact

**Before**:
- 5 pages, average position 35
- 2,173 impressions split
- ~0% CTR (position too low)
- 0 clicks

- 1 page, consolidated link equity

- Expected position: 8-15 (VCC level)
- Expected CTR: 4-6%
- Expected clicks: 87-130/month
- Expected bookings: 9-13/month
- **Expected revenue: $15,750-$22,750/month**

### Action Items

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Redirects Cause Temporary Ranking Drop
**Mitigation**:
- Monitor daily in GSC
- Keep old pages live for 7 days before redirecting
- Add canonical tags first, then redirect after confirming no issues

### Risk 2: New Pages Don't Rank Fast Enough
**Mitigation**:
- Focus first on optimizing existing high-impression pages
- New pages are bonus, not primary strategy
- Use internal linking to pass authority quickly

### Risk 3: CTAs Don't Improve Conversion
**Mitigation**:
- A/B test multiple CTA variations
- Monitor heatmaps if possible
- Get user feedback on booking process

### Risk 4: Burlington Consolidation Doesn't Improve Position
**Mitigation**:
- Already rebuilt with full VCC structure (strong foundation)
- Adding internal links for extra boost
- Worst case: Keep monitoring, position will improve within 8-12 weeks
