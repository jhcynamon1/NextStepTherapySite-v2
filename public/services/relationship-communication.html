                <p class="lead text-center mb-xl">
                    Healthy relationships are the foundation of a fulfilling life, yet many of us were never taught 
                    the essential skills for effective communication and emotional connection. Whether you're struggling 
                    in your current relationship or wanting to build better relationship skills, you're not alone.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Relationship challenges affect every couple at some point, and they don't necessarily mean your 
                    relationship is doomed. Often, the issues that bring couples to therapy – communication breakdowns, 
                    recurring conflicts, emotional distance, intimacy concerns – are symptoms of deeper patterns that 
                    can be changed with the right approach and commitment from both partners.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    My approach to relationship therapy isn't about assigning blame or trying to change your partner. 
                    Instead, we focus on helping you develop the skills and perspectives needed to create the kind of 
                    relationship you both want. Using ACT principles, we'll work on increasing psychological flexibility, 
                    improving communication, and aligning your relationship with your shared values and goals.

                <p class="lead text-center mb-xl">
                    Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is highly effective for relationship issues because it focuses 
                    on psychological flexibility, values-based living, and mindful communication – essential ingredients 
                    for healthy, lasting relationships.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Rather than trying to eliminate conflict or difficult emotions from your relationship, ACT teaches 
                    you and your partner how to navigate challenges together while staying connected to what matters most 
                    to both of you. This approach helps create resilient relationships that can handle life's inevitable 
                    ups and downs while maintaining intimacy, respect, and mutual support.
                </p>

                                Learn to listen with full presence and speak from awareness rather than reactivity. 
                                Develop skills for staying present during difficult conversations without getting 
                                defensive or shutting down.

                                Accept that you and your partner are different people with different perspectives, 
                                needs, and ways of processing emotions. Learn to work with differences rather than 
                                against them.

                                Identify what you both value in a relationship and use those shared values as a guide
