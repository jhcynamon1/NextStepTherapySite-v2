                <h2 class="text-center">Men's Mental Health: Breaking Through the Barriers</h2>
                <p class="lead text-center mb-xl">
                    Men are three times more likely to die by suicide than women, yet they're significantly less likely 
                    to seek mental health support. Traditional masculine expectations often create barriers to seeking help, 
                    but your mental health is too important to let societal pressures stand in the way.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    As a male therapist, I understand the unique pressures men face – the expectation to be stoic, to have 
                    all the answers, to shoulder burdens alone. I also know that beneath these expectations are real human 
                    experiences: stress, doubt, loneliness, relationship challenges, career pressures, and the weight of 
                    responsibility that can feel overwhelming.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    My approach to men's mental health isn't about changing who you are or making you more "emotional." 
                    It's about equipping you with practical tools to handle life's challenges more effectively, improving 
                    your relationships, and helping you build the kind of life you actually want to live. We'll work together 
                    in a straightforward, goal-oriented way that respects your time and focuses on real-world results.

                <p class="lead text-center mb-xl">
                    Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is particularly effective for men because it focuses on 
                    action, values, and practical skills rather than just talking about feelings. It's about building 
                    psychological flexibility to handle whatever life throws at you.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In our work together, we won't spend endless sessions analyzing your childhood or forcing you to 
                    express emotions in ways that don't feel authentic. Instead, we'll focus on what's happening in 
                    your life right now, what you want to change, and the specific skills you need to get there. 
                    This approach respects your time, your goals, and your preferred communication style.

                                We'll identify what's not working in your life, what you want to change, and what 
                                obstacles are getting in your way. No judgment, no lengthy histories – just clear 
                                problem identification and goal setting.

                <h2 class="text-center">Frequently Asked Questions from Men</h2>
                
                <div style="margin-top: 3rem;">
                    <h3>I've never been to therapy before. What's it actually like?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Think of it more like consulting with a coach or advisor who specializes in helping men handle 
                        life's challenges more effectively. We sit and talk about what's not working, identify specific 
                        goals, and develop practical strategies. It's collaborative, not confrontational.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Do I have to talk about my feelings all the time?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Not at all. While emotions are part of the human experience, we focus more on what you want to 
                        accomplish and the obstacles in your way. If emotions are relevant to your goals, we'll address 
                        them practically, not dramatically.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>How long does therapy typically take for men?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Most men see significant improvement in 8-16 sessions, depending on their goals. Some prefer 
                        shorter-term focused work on specific issues, while others benefit from longer-term support 
                        for ongoing life management. We'll discuss what makes sense for your situation.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Will this help with work stress and career issues?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Absolutely. Many of the men I work with are dealing with workplace stress, career transitions, 
                        or work-life balance issues. We'll focus on practical strategies for managing these challenges 
                        while maintaining your professional effectiveness.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Is virtual therapy effective for men's issues?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Many men actually prefer virtual therapy because it's more convenient and private. You can have 
                        sessions from your office, home, or even your car. It eliminates the stigma some men feel about 
                        being seen entering a therapy office.
