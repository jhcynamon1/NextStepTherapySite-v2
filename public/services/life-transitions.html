                <h2 class="text-center">Understanding Life Transitions: Embracing Change as Growth</h2>
                <p class="lead text-center mb-xl">
                    Life transitions are inevitable crossroads that challenge our sense of identity, purpose, and direction. 
                    Whether chosen or unexpected, these moments of change can feel overwhelming, disorienting, and isolating.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Major life transitions affect approximately 75% of adults at any given time, yet we're rarely taught how to 
                    navigate them effectively. You might be experiencing a career pivot, relationship change, loss of a loved one, 
                    becoming a parent, facing retirement, or questioning your life's direction. These transitions aren't just 
                    external changes – they're profound internal transformations that reshape how we see ourselves and our place 
                    in the world.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    As someone who has guided hundreds of individuals through significant life changes, I understand that 
                    transitions are more than just moving from point A to point B. They're complex psychological processes that 
                    involve grieving what was, sitting with uncertainty, and courageously stepping into what could be. My role 
                    is to provide you with the tools, support, and perspective needed to transform these challenging periods 
                    into opportunities for growth and self-discovery.

            <div class="container-narrow">
                <h2 class="text-center">My Approach: ACT for Life Transitions</h2>
                <p class="lead text-center mb-xl">
                    Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is uniquely suited for navigating life transitions because it 
                    helps you develop psychological flexibility – the ability to stay present and engaged even when life 
                    feels uncertain or uncomfortable.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Unlike traditional approaches that might focus on "getting through" transitions quickly or returning to 
                    "normal," ACT recognizes that transitions are rich opportunities for growth. We don't try to eliminate 
                    the discomfort of change; instead, we learn to move through it with grace and purpose. This approach is 
                    particularly powerful because it helps you connect with your values – your deepest sense of what matters – 
                    which becomes your compass during times of uncertainty.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Core ACT Principles for Transitions</h3>

                        <div class="timeline-content">
                            <h4>Acceptance of What Is</h4>
                            <p>
                                Learn to acknowledge and make space for difficult emotions without being overwhelmed by them. 
                                This isn't resignation – it's creating room to feel the full spectrum of your experience 
                                while still moving forward.

                            <h4>Cognitive Defusion</h4>
                            <p>
                                Develop the ability to observe your thoughts about the transition without being controlled 
                                by them. Stories like "I'm too old to change" or "I'll never recover from this" lose their 
                                power when you see them as thoughts, not truths.

                            <p>
                                Identify what truly matters to you beyond circumstances. Your values become the North Star 
                                that guides decisions and actions during uncertain times, helping you create meaning even 
                                in difficult transitions.

                                Take purposeful steps aligned with your values, even when you feel afraid or uncertain. 
                                Small, values-based actions build momentum and confidence, creating positive change even

                                Cultivate the ability to stay grounded in the here and now, rather than getting lost in 
                                regrets about the past or anxiety about the future. Mindfulness becomes your anchor during

                    <h3>Career and Professional Transitions</h3>
                    <p>
                        Career transitions are among the most challenging because they often involve not just practical changes 
                        but deep questions about identity, worth, and purpose. Whether you're facing unexpected job loss, 
                        considering a career pivot, struggling with retirement, or launching a business, I help you navigate 
                        both the practical and emotional aspects of professional change. We'll explore what success means to 
                        you beyond external markers, address fears about financial security and professional identity, and 
                        develop strategies for making decisions aligned with your authentic self.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Relationship and Family Transitions</h3>
                    <p>
                        Relationships form the foundation of our lives, and when they change, everything can feel unstable. 
                        I provide support through divorce and separation, helping you process grief while building a vision 
                        for your future. For those entering new relationships or marriages, we work on maintaining your 
                        individual identity while building partnership. Parents navigating the transition to parenthood or 
                        empty nest syndrome find support in redefining themselves beyond their parental role. We also address 
                        the complex dynamics of caring for aging parents and shifting family relationships.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Loss and Grief Transitions</h3>
                    <p>
                        Grief is a natural response to loss, but our culture often rushes us through it or expects us to 
                        "move on" quickly. I provide a space where your grief is honored and witnessed. Whether you're 
                        mourning the death of a loved one, the end of a relationship, loss of health, or even the loss of 
                        a dream or expectation, we work together to integrate loss into your life story in a way that honors 
                        what was while making room for what might be. This isn't about "getting over" grief but learning to 
                        carry it with grace.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Identity and Existential Transitions</h3>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes the most profound transitions are internal – questioning who you are, what you believe, or 
                        what your life means. These might be triggered by milestone birthdays, health crises, spiritual 
                        experiences, or simply a growing sense that something needs to change. I provide a non-judgmental 
                        space to explore these deep questions. Whether you're navigating a midlife transition, exploring 
                        changes in sexual or gender identity, questioning religious or spiritual beliefs, or simply feeling 
                        lost, we work together to help you find your authentic path.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Health and Lifestyle Transitions</h3>
                    <p>
                        Health changes – whether sudden or gradual – force us to reconsider our relationship with our bodies 
                        and our mortality. I support individuals adjusting to chronic illness diagnoses, recovering from 
                        accidents or medical procedures, navigating changes in physical or cognitive abilities, and adapting 
                        to new lifestyle requirements. We focus not just on accepting limitations but on discovering new 
                        sources of vitality, purpose, and joy within changed circumstances.

                                We'll have a brief conversation about what you're going through and what you're hoping to 
                                achieve. This helps us both determine if we're a good therapeutic fit. There's no pressure 
                                to commit – it's simply a chance to connect and explore possibilities.

                                We'll explore your transition in depth – what triggered it, how it's affecting you, what 
                                you've already tried, and what you're hoping for. We'll also begin identifying your values 
                                and strengths that will serve as resources during this time.

                                You'll learn specific ACT techniques for managing difficult emotions, unhelpful thought 
                                patterns, and uncertainty. These aren't just coping strategies – they're life skills that

                                toward new goals. You'll build confidence in your ability to navigate the transition.

                    <h3>How do I know if I need therapy for my life transition?</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you're feeling overwhelmed, stuck, or unable to move forward; if the transition is affecting 
                        your sleep, appetite, or relationships; if you're experiencing persistent anxiety or depression; 
                        or if you simply want professional support during a challenging time – therapy can help. You don't 
                        need to be in crisis to benefit from support.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>How long does therapy for life transitions typically take?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Every transition is unique, but many clients find significant relief and clarity within 8-12 sessions. 
                        Some transitions require longer-term support, while others resolve more quickly. We'll regularly 
                        assess your progress and adjust our approach as needed.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Can therapy really help if my situation can't change?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Absolutely. While we can't always change external circumstances (like loss or health diagnoses), 
                        therapy helps you change your relationship to these realities. You'll develop resilience, find 
                        meaning, and discover ways to thrive even within constraints.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>What if I'm not good at talking about emotions?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Many clients, particularly those who haven't been to therapy before, share this concern. ACT is 
                        action-oriented and practical – we don't just talk about feelings, we develop concrete strategies. 
                        I'll meet you where you're comfortable and help you gradually expand your emotional vocabulary.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Is virtual therapy as effective as in-person?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Research consistently shows that virtual therapy is as effective as in-person therapy for most 
                        concerns, including life transitions. Many clients actually prefer virtual sessions for the 
                        convenience and comfort they provide.
