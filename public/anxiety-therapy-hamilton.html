                    <h2>Anxiety in High-Achievers Looks Different</h2>
                    <p>For a driven professional in Hamilton, anxiety isn't always panic attacks. It's often a constant, low-grade hum of pressure that shows up as:</p>
                    <ul class="feature-list">
                        <li><strong>Procrastination & Avoidance:</strong> Putting off important tasks because the fear of not doing them perfectly is overwhelming.</li>
                        <li><strong>Overthinking & Analysis Paralysis:</strong> Getting stuck in your head, unable to make decisions for fear of making the wrong one.</li>
                        <li><strong>Constant Urgency:</strong> Feeling like you're always behind, even when you're ahead, and never truly being able to switch off.</li>
                        <li><strong>Irritability & Burnout:</strong> Snapping at colleagues or family because your capacity to handle stress is completely depleted.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You don't have to live this way. We provide practical therapy that gives you the tools to manage anxiety without sacrificing your ambition.</p>

                     <ul class="feature-list">
                        <li>Reduces anxiety symptoms and panic attacks</li>
                        <li>Decreases the believability of anxious thoughts</li>
                        <li>Increases engagement in meaningful activities</li>
                        <li>Builds long-term psychological resilience</li>
                        <li>Reduces workplace stress and prevents burnout</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>You can feel confident that you are receiving a top-tier, evidence-based treatment designed to create lasting change.</p>
