                <p class="lead text-center mb-xl">
                    Depression affects 1 in 8 Torontonians at some point in their lives. If you're struggling with 
                    persistent sadness, emptiness, or loss of interest in life, you're not alone.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Living in Toronto comes with unique pressures - the fast pace, high cost of living, career demands, 
                    and social isolation can all contribute to depression. Whether you're a professional dealing with 
                    burnout, a student facing academic pressure, or someone navigating life transitions, depression can 
                    make everything feel overwhelming.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Depression isn't just feeling sad. It's a complex experience that affects your thoughts, emotions, 
                    physical health, and behavior. You might find yourself withdrawing from friends, struggling to get 
                    out of bed, or feeling like nothing will ever improve. These experiences are valid, and with the 
                    right support, things can get better.

                <h2 class="text-center">My ACT Approach to Depression</h2>
                <p class="lead text-center mb-xl">
                    Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) offers a different path forward - one that doesn't 
                    require you to "fix" yourself or eliminate difficult emotions.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Unlike traditional approaches that focus on changing negative thoughts, ACT helps you develop 
                    psychological flexibility - the ability to stay present and engaged with your life, even when 
                    experiencing difficult emotions. This approach is particularly effective for depression because 
                    it helps you reconnect with your values and take meaningful action, even when motivation is low.
                </p>

                            <h4>Acceptance Over Avoidance</h4>
                            <p>
                                Learn to make space for difficult emotions rather than exhausting yourself 
                                trying to push them away. This isn't about giving up - it's about stopping 
                                the struggle that makes depression worse.

                            <p>
                                Develop the ability to observe negative thoughts without being controlled by 
                                them. Thoughts like "I'm worthless" or "nothing will change" lose their power 
                                when you see them as mental events, not facts.

                                Identify what truly matters to you beneath the depression. Your values become 
                                the compass that guides you forward when everything else feels uncertain.

                                creates momentum, and momentum creates change, even in depression.

                            No formal diagnosis is required. If you're struggling with low mood, lack of motivation, 
                            or other depressive symptoms, therapy can help regardless of labels.

                        <p>
                            ACT focuses on accepting difficult emotions while taking values-based action, rather 
                            than trying to eliminate negative thoughts. It's about living fully even with depression.

                        <p>
                            Absolutely. Different approaches work for different people. ACT offers a unique 
                            perspective that many find helpful when other therapies haven't clicked.
