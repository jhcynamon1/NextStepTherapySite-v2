                    <p>Anxiety affects millions of people across Ontario, and it's more than just occasional worry. If you're experiencing any of these, professional anxiety counseling can help:</p>
                    <ul class="feature-list">
                        <li><strong>Persistent Worry:</strong> Your mind races with "what if" scenarios, making it hard to focus on anything else or enjoy the present moment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Physical Symptoms:</strong> Racing heart, sweating, muscle tension, headaches, or digestive issues that seem to come out of nowhere.</li>
                        <li><strong>Avoidance Patterns:</strong> You find yourself avoiding situations, people, or activities that might trigger anxiety, making your world feel smaller.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sleep Disruption:</strong> Anxiety keeps you awake at night or causes restless, unrefreshing sleep that leaves you exhausted.</li>
                        <li><strong>Impact on Relationships:</strong> Anxiety affects your ability to connect with others or causes conflict in your personal and professional relationships.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You deserve to live without constant anxiety controlling your decisions and limiting your life. Professional counseling can help you regain control.</p>
