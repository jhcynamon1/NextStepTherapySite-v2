                    <h2>Does This Sound Familiar?</h2>
                    <p>For many high-achieving professionals in Ontario, the internal struggle isn't about a lack of knowledge, but a battle with your own mind. It can look like:</p>
                    <ul class="feature-list">
                        <li><strong>Knowing What To Do, But Not Doing It:</strong> You feel stuck in cycles of procrastination or avoidance, even when you know the logical next step.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fighting With Your Own Thoughts:</strong> You spend huge amounts of energy trying to argue with, suppress, or ignore anxious or self-critical thoughts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Feeling Disconnected:</strong> You're successful on the outside, but you feel disconnected from a sense of meaning or purpose in your work and life.</li>
                        <li><strong>Waiting to 'Feel Better' to Start Living:</strong> You put off important goals, waiting for motivation or confidence to show up first.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>ACT provides a way out of these traps by teaching you to work with your mind differently, not harder.</p>

                    <h2>How ACT Therapy Works: A Shift in Focus</h2>
                    <p>ACT isn't about getting rid of unwanted thoughts or feelings. It's about developing psychological flexibilityâ€”the ability to stay present and take meaningful action, no matter what's going on inside your head.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Core Skills You'll Learn:</h3>
                    <ul class="feature-list">
                        <li><strong>Defusion:</strong> Learning to step back and observe your thoughts instead of getting entangled in them. You'll see that thoughts are just thoughts, not commands.</li>
                        <li><strong>Acceptance:</strong> Making room for uncomfortable feelings without letting them stop you. It's not about liking the feeling, but about allowing it to be there.</li>
                        <li><strong>Present Moment Awareness:</strong> Grounding yourself in the here and now, which helps you get out of your head and engage with the world around you.</li>
                        <li><strong>Values Clarification:</strong> Connecting with what truly matters to you. Your values become your compass for making decisions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Committed Action:</strong> Taking small, consistent steps towards the life you want to live, guided by your values.</li>
                    </ul>
