                <p class="lead text-center mb-xl">
                    Virtual therapy offers the same professional support as in-person sessions, with added 
                    convenience and accessibility for people throughout Ontario.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Research consistently shows that online therapy is as effective as in-person therapy for 
                    treating depression. Through secure video sessions, you can access professional support 
                    from the comfort of your own space - whether that's your home, office, or any private 
                    location with internet access.

                <p>
                    Online therapy removes many barriers to getting help. There's no commute, no sitting in 
                    waiting rooms, and no need to take extended time off work. For many people dealing with 
                    depression, the ability to access therapy from a familiar, comfortable environment makes 
                    it easier to engage in the therapeutic process.

                    Acceptance and Commitment Therapy translates perfectly to the online format, offering 
                    powerful tools for depression recovery.

                <p>
                    ACT focuses on developing psychological flexibility - the ability to stay present with 
                    difficult emotions while taking steps toward what matters to you. This approach is 
                    particularly well-suited to online therapy because many of the exercises and techniques 
                    can be practiced right in your own environment.

                <p class="lead text-center mb-xl">
                    Virtual therapy offers unique advantages when you're dealing with depression.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Depression creates barriers to getting help - low energy, difficulty leaving home, anxiety 
                    about being seen in a waiting room. Online therapy removes many of these obstacles, making 
                    it easier to access support when you need it most.

                                When depression makes everything exhausting, eliminating the commute means you 
                                have more energy for the actual therapy work. You can rest before and after 
                                sessions without travel stress.

                                Being in your own space can make it easier to open up. You're surrounded by
