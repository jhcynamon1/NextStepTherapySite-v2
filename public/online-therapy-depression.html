                    Virtual therapy offers the same professional support as in-person sessions, with added 
                    convenience and accessibility for people throughout Ontario.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Research consistently shows that online therapy is as effective as in-person therapy for 
                    treating depression. Through secure video sessions, you can access professional support 
                    from the comfort of your own space - whether that's your home, office, or any private 
                    location with internet access.

                <p>
                    Online therapy removes many barriers to getting help. There's no commute, no sitting in 
                    waiting rooms, and no need to take extended time off work. For many people dealing with 
                    depression, the ability to access therapy from a familiar, comfortable environment makes 
                    it easier to engage in the therapeutic process.

                <p class="lead text-center mb-xl">
                    Acceptance and Commitment Therapy translates perfectly to the online format, offering 
                    powerful tools for depression recovery.

                <p>
                    ACT focuses on developing psychological flexibility - the ability to stay present with 
                    difficult emotions while taking steps toward what matters to you. This approach is 
                    particularly well-suited to online therapy because many of the exercises and techniques 
                    can be practiced right in your own environment.

                        <p>
                            Yes, extensive research shows online therapy is equally effective for treating 
                            depression. Many people find they can open up more easily from the comfort of 
                            their own space.

                        <p>
                            The platform is very user-friendly - if you can use email, you can do online 
                            therapy. I provide tech support if needed, and we always have phone backup 
                            as an option.

                            Online therapy works well for most people with depression. During our free 
                            consultation, we can discuss your specific needs and whether virtual sessions 
                            would be a good fit.

                        <h3>What about privacy and confidentiality?</h3>
                        <p>
                            All sessions use encrypted, PHIPA-compliant platforms. Your privacy is protected 
                            just as it would be in an office setting. I follow all professional standards 
                            for confidentiality.
