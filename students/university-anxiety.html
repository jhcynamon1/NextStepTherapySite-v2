                <div class="content-text">
                    <p>If you're reading this between study sessions, lying awake at 3 AM worrying about assignments, or feeling that familiar knot in your stomach before class, you're experiencing what thousands of Ontario university students face every day.</p>

                    <p>University anxiety isn't just "normal stress." It's that persistent feeling that you're not good enough, smart enough, or doing enough. It's the racing thoughts during lectures, the paralysis when starting assignments, and the constant comparison to classmates who seem to have it all together.</p>

                    <h3>Common Signs You Might Be Struggling:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Procrastinating on assignments until the last minute, then panicking</li>
                        <li>Avoiding classes or social situations on campus</li>
                        <li>Physical symptoms like headaches, stomach issues, or trouble sleeping</li>
                        <li>Constantly second-guessing yourself and your abilities</li>
                        <li>Feeling overwhelmed by the workload and expectations</li>
                        <li>Difficulty concentrating or retaining information</li>
                        <li>Withdrawing from friends and activities you used to enjoy</li>

                    <p>Learn evidence-based techniques to calm your nervous system, challenge anxious thoughts, and break the cycle of worry and avoidance. These aren't just theories—they're practical strategies you can use before exams, presentations, or social situations.</p>

                    <h3>Academic Performance Without Burnout</h3>
                    <p>Develop sustainable study habits, overcome perfectionism and procrastination, and learn how to manage your energy throughout the semester. Success doesn't have to come at the cost of your mental health.</p>

                    <h3>Building Confidence and Self-Worth</h3>
                    <p>Address imposter syndrome, develop a stronger sense of self beyond grades, and learn to value your unique strengths and perspectives. You belong at university, even when anxiety tells you otherwise.</p>

                    <h3>Stress Resilience</h3>
                    <p>Build your capacity to handle university pressures without becoming overwhelmed. Learn how to bounce back from setbacks and maintain perspective during challenging times.</p>
