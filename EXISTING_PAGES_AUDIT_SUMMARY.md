# Existing Pages SEO Performance Audit Summary

## 1. Objective

The goal of this audit is to analyze the current SEO performance of key existing pages on `nextsteptherapy.ca`. Due to persistent technical failures with content scraping tools (Firecrawl), we have pivoted to a performance audit using DataForSEO. This analysis reveals which keywords the pages are currently ranking for, their positions, and search volumes.

This data will be used to generate strategic recommendations from Perplexity for on-page optimization, content enhancement, and keyword targeting to improve organic traffic and support the "Digital Landlord" business model.

## 2. Methodology

A performance audit was conducted using the DataForSEO "Ranked Keywords" API. Each target URL was analyzed for its current keyword rankings in Google (Canada, English).

## 3. Key Findings & Analysis

The audit reveals a clear and consistent pattern: the website has some domain authority, but the individual pages are significantly under-optimized and are not ranking for valuable, non-branded keywords.

### 3.1. Homepage (`/`) - The Only Page with Non-Branded Rankings

*   **Branded Keyword:** `next step counselling`
    *   **Monthly Searches:** 260
    *   **Current Rank:** #19
    *   **Analysis:** This is a healthy branded search ranking. It shows good brand recognition.

*   **Non-Branded Keyword:** `performance therapy`
    *   **Monthly Searches:** 70
    *   **Current Rank:** #54 (via the `performance-anxiety.html` page)
    *   **Analysis:** This is our most significant finding. It's a "ghost ranking"â€”unintentional but powerful. It proves the site *can* rank for commercial-intent keywords. The low rank (#54) indicates a massive opportunity for optimization. A targeted effort could likely move this page into the top 10.

### 3.2. All Other Pages - Zero Keyword Rankings

The following key pages were analyzed and found to have **zero ranking keywords**:

*   `anxiety-counseling-ontario.html`
*   `therapist-london-ontario.html`
*   `guide-to-work-stress-management.html`
*   `university-of-toronto-counselling.html`

**Analysis:** This is not a negative finding; it is a massive opportunity. These pages represent untapped potential. They currently act as digital business cards but are not functioning as lead-generating SEO assets. With proper on-page optimization, they could be transformed into valuable "digital properties."

## 4. Strategic Implications & Next Steps

1.  **Massive Optimization Opportunity:** The entire site is a blank slate for targeted SEO. Nearly every page can be improved to rank for valuable keywords.
2.  **Validate with "Performance Therapy":** The "ghost ranking" for `performance therapy` is a perfect test case. We can focus on optimizing the `performance-anxiety.html` page to see how quickly we can achieve a page-one ranking.
3.  **Apply Learnings to New Content:** The lack of rankings on existing pages underscores the importance of our new content production plan. The 5 new pages we are creating must be perfectly optimized from day one.

**Next Step:** Feed this summary into Perplexity to generate a specific, actionable list of recommendations for:
    a. Optimizing the existing, underperforming pages.
    b. Deciding whether to duplicate existing pages for more specific local targeting (e.g., creating a `therapist-toronto.html` based on the `therapist-london-ontario.html` template).
