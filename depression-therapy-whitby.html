              Depression therapy helps people navigate persistent low mood, loss of motivation, and the sense that life has lost its color. For Whitby residents dealing with the weight of daily demands and long commutes, therapy offers support to reconnect with what matters. Research shows approximately 5.4% of Canadian adults experience a major depressive episode each year.

              The alarm goes off and you're already tired. Not sleepy. Tired of everything. The commute, the routine, the same conversations, the same feeling that something is missing but you can't name what. You go through the motions because that's what you're supposed to do.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg text-navy/80 leading-relaxed">
              If any of that resonates, you're not lazy or broken. You're dealing with something real. And there's a way through it.

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-navy/80">
          <p>
            Depression isn't a character flaw or a weakness. It's a real condition that affects how you think, feel, and function. Therapy doesn't magically fix it overnight. But it gives you tools and perspective that can genuinely change things.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here's what I've seen working with clients from Durham Region: depression often makes sense in context. There are real pressures. Real exhaustion. Real reasons why you feel the way you do. The problem is that depression distorts everything. It tells you nothing will work, nothing matters, nothing will change. That voice is loud and convincing. But it's not accurate.
          </p>

          <p>
            I use Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), which has strong research support. The focus isn't on forcing yourself to feel better. It's on reconnecting with what matters to you and taking small steps in that direction, even when motivation is low.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy mt-8 mb-4">What we typically work on:</h3>

          <ul class="space-y-3">
            <li>Understanding what depression is actually doing to your thinking and energy</li>
            <li>Identifying what you actually value, not just what you "should" want</li>
            <li>Taking meaningful action even when motivation is absent</li>
            <li>Developing a different relationship with difficult thoughts and feelings</li>
            <li>Rebuilding a sense of purpose and connection</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="mt-6">
            The goal isn't to never feel sad or tired. The goal is to stop depression from running your life.

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy mb-2">How quickly can I get an appointment?</h3>
            <p class="text-navy/70">
              Most clients get their first session within the same week. I know Durham Region waitlists can be months long. When you're ready to start, you shouldn't have to wait.

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy mb-2">What type of therapy do you use for depression?</h3>
            <p class="text-navy/70">
              I use Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), an evidence-based approach. Instead of trying to eliminate difficult feelings, we work on building a life that feels meaningful even when things are hard.

          <div class="bg-warm-white p-6 rounded-xl border border-sand">
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy mb-2">Can therapy help when I feel like nothing will work?</h3>
            <p class="text-navy/70">
              That feeling is actually a symptom of depression. Your brain is telling you nothing will help as a way to protect you from disappointment. But that same brain is also filtering out evidence that things can change.

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-navy mb-2">What if I've never done therapy before?</h3>
            <p class="text-navy/70">
              Most people I work with haven't. The first session is about getting to know each other. You don't need to have anything figured out. That's my job to help guide.
