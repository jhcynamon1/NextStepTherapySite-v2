## 💡 **Key Insights from Your Guide:**

### **The 95% Rule**
"95% of long-tail, location-specific keywords show 'no data' in traditional tools. This represents thousands of untapped opportunities."

**Applied to NextStepTherapy:**
- Don't target "anxiety therapy toronto downtown" directly
- Target "anxiety therapy" seed → discover related terms
- Build pages for natural language variations

### **The "No Data" Goldmine**
When we get NULL results, it means:
- Zero systematic competition
- Untapped search volume  
- Immediate ranking potential
- User intent being ignored

### **Content Depth Strategy (2,500+ Words)**
Each page needs:
1. **Problem Awareness** (400 words) - Validate searcher's problem
2. **Solution Overview** (500 words) - How service helps
3. **Local Authority** (400 words) - Ontario-specific content
4. **Trust Building** (400 words) - Credentials, success stories
5. **Practical Information** (400 words) - Booking, insurance, process
6. **Call to Action** (300 words) - Multiple CTA options
