# 30-Day Stability Monitoring Checklist

**Period:** October 29 - November 28, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ PHASE 1 COMPLETE - Site Already Configured Correctly
**Next Action Date:** December 1, 2025

---

## üéØ The Mission

**ZERO changes to the site for 30 days.**

Your site is already configured perfectly:
- ‚úÖ `cleanUrls: false` in vercel.json
- ‚úÖ 301/308 redirects in place for all URLs
- ‚úÖ Self-referential canonical tags with .html
- ‚úÖ All technical SEO foundations solid

The 706 GSC "Not Indexed" errors are **historical duplicates** from before the cleanUrls fix. They will clear naturally as Google recrawls.

**What to Track:**
1. Open Google Search Console
2. Navigate to: Indexing ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Not indexed

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Primary Metric: GSC "Not Indexed" Count
**Goal:** Drop from 706 ‚Üí 100-200 by Nov 28

**What it means if it drops:**
‚úÖ Google is recrawling and removing duplicates
‚úÖ Technical fix is working
‚úÖ Site stability being restored

**What it means if it stays at 706:**
‚ö†Ô∏è Google hasn't recrawled yet (give it 10-14 days)
‚ö†Ô∏è Possible other technical issues (investigate after 14 days)

### Secondary Metric: Total Clicks
**Current baseline:** 0-2 clicks/day (post-crash)
**Goal:** Return to 2-6 clicks/day by mid-December

**Timeline:**
- Weeks 1-4 (Oct 29 - Nov 28): Likely still 0-2 clicks/day
- Week 5-6 (Nov 29 - Dec 10): May see 1-3 clicks/day
- Week 7-8 (Dec 11 - Dec 24): Should recover to 2-6 clicks/day

### Tertiary Metric: Impressions
**Current:** Growing (250K/month)
**Goal:** Maintain or grow

**What to watch:**
- If impressions drop >20%: Investigate immediately
- If impressions grow: Great! CTR optimization will amplify this

## üîç What to Do If...

### If errors don't drop by Nov 12:
1. Check GSC for new error types
2. Verify vercel.json still has cleanUrls: false
3. Run curl tests to confirm redirects working
4. Wait 7 more days (Google can be slow)

### If traffic crashes further:
1. Check GSC for manual actions
2. Check Analytics for referral spam
3. Verify site is still live (run curl tests)
4. Check Vercel deployment logs

### If you MUST make a change:
1. Document why it's urgent
2. Make smallest possible change
3. Commit to git with detailed message
4. Deploy and verify
5. Reset 30-day counter to Day 1

## üéì Key Insights

### Manus Was Right
> "At DR 2.7, Google is less forgiving. Site stability is non-negotiable."

### The Math
- 195 actual pages
- √ó 2 URL versions (with/without .html) when cleanUrls was enabled
- = 390 URLs Google indexed
- 195 correct versions + 195 duplicates + some backups = 706 errors

### The Fix Was Already Done
- vercel.json already had cleanUrls: false
- 301/308 redirects already in place
- Canonical tags already correct
- Just waiting for Google to catch up

### The Timeline
- Fix implemented: Unknown (sometime before Oct 29)
- Google notices: Starting Oct 29
- Errors clear: 7-14 days (by Nov 12)
- Traffic recovers: 4-8 weeks (by mid-Dec)
