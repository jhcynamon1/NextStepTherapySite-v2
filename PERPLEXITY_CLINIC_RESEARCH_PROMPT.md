# üè• CLINIC-FOCUSED MARKET RESEARCH: Ontario Therapy Lead Generation
*Targeting Multi-Therapist Practices Instead of Individual Therapists*

---

## üìã RESEARCH OBJECTIVE

**Re-analyze the Ontario therapy lead generation market focusing on CLINICS (multi-therapist practices) rather than individual therapists.**

- Larger marketing budgets ($500-2,000/month)
- Higher lead volume needs (50-150 leads/month)
- More sophisticated business operations
- Better ability to pay premium pricing

## üî• BOTTOM LINE QUESTION

**Is targeting therapy clinics instead of individual therapists a fundamentally better business opportunity?**

The individual therapist market showed $2.7M SOM with significant budget constraints. Clinics might offer:
- **Larger market opportunity** (higher budgets per customer)
- **Better unit economics** (higher LTV, lower CAC)
- **More sustainable business model** (less price sensitivity)
- **Easier sales process** (business-to-business vs. individual practitioners)

**Provide definitive analysis on whether pivoting to clinic-focused lead generation changes the market opportunity from "proceed with caution" to "strong opportunity."**
