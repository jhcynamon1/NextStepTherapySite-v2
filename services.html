                    <p>At Next Step Therapy, we provide professional mental health support grounded in research and tailored to your unique needs. Our approach combines evidence-based therapeutic methods with genuine understanding and practical strategies you can use in daily life.</p>
                    <p>Whether you're dealing with anxiety that keeps you up at night, depression that makes everything feel heavy, workplace stress that follows you home, or major life transitions that feel overwhelming, we're here to help you navigate these challenges.</p>

                <div class="content-text">
                    <p>Every person's journey is unique, which is why we don't believe in one-size-fits-all therapy. Our approach integrates multiple evidence-based modalities to create a personalized treatment plan that works for you.</p>
                    <p>We draw from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), helping you develop psychological flexibility and live according to your values even when facing difficult emotions. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques help identify and shift unhelpful thought patterns. Mindfulness practices build awareness and reduce reactivity to stress.</p>
                    <p>But beyond techniques and theories, we believe in the power of genuine human connection. Therapy is a collaborative process where you're the expert on your life, and we provide professional guidance, tools, and support to help you create meaningful change.</p>

                    <p>Living in Ontario means dealing with long commutes, busy schedules, and sometimes limited access to mental health services in your area. Virtual therapy eliminates these barriers, making professional support accessible no matter where you are in the province.</p>
                    <p>From Toronto to Thunder Bay, Ottawa to Windsor, we provide the same quality of care through secure video sessions. You can attend therapy from your home, office, or any private space where you feel comfortable.</p>
                    <p>Virtual sessions are just as effective as in-person therapy, with the added benefits of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>No commute time or parking stress</li>
