                <li><strong>Homepage hero, main service pages:</strong> 70/30 (trust + conversion)</li>
                <li><strong>About page, How I Work:</strong> 80/20 (maximum authenticity)</li>
                <li><strong>City/location pages, long-tail:</strong> 60/40 (SEO priority)</li>
                <li><strong>Blog, email, social:</strong> 80/20 or higher (pure voice)</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The 70/30 is the sweet spot for most therapy pages—authentic enough to build trust, structured enough to convert and rank.</p>

                    <p>Most clients notice improvements within 8-12 weeks of consistent sessions. Duration varies based on your specific situation and goals. Some see initial relief within 3-4 sessions, while others benefit from longer-term support.</p>

                    <p>Honestly, I can't give you a number that would be true for everyone. Some people start feeling different within a few weeks; others need more time. What I've noticed is that the timeline matters less than whether we're actually connecting. That awareness piece? That's often where change starts.</p>
