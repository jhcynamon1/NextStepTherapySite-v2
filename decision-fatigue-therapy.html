The avoidance, the irritability, the impulsive choices you regret—that's not a character flaw."

                <h2 class="section-title">What Is Decision Fatigue?</h2>
                <p><strong>Decision fatigue is the deterioration of decision-making quality that occurs after a prolonged period of making choices, leading to impaired judgment, avoidance, or impulsive decisions.</strong> Research shows humans make approximately 35,000 decisions daily, and each one depletes finite cognitive resources. Unlike physical fatigue, decision fatigue often goes unrecognized—people attribute poor choices to character flaws rather than depleted mental capacity. Evidence-based therapy using ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) helps professionals develop sustainable decision-making systems and "unhook" from overthinking patterns.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 2rem;">Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is particularly effective for decision fatigue because it addresses both the overthinking patterns and the underlying anxiety about making "wrong" choices.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq-question">What is decision fatigue?</h3>
                        <p class="faq-answer">Here's what I've seen: decision fatigue shows up when your brain has made so many choices that even simple ones feel impossible. You're not losing your edge—you're depleted. Research shows we make roughly 35,000 decisions daily, and by late afternoon, most people are running on fumes. The avoidance, the irritability, the impulsive choices you regret—that's not a character flaw.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq-question">How does therapy help with decision fatigue?</h3>
                        <p class="faq-answer">We work on two things: first, unhooking from the overthinking spiral—that loop where you analyze every angle but still can't pull the trigger. Second, figuring out what actually matters to you so decisions get simpler. When you're clear on your values, you don't need to weigh every option. You already know.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3 class="faq-question">Is decision fatigue the same as burnout?</h3>
                        <p class="faq-answer">They're related but different. Decision fatigue is specific—your brain's capacity for choices is tapped out. Burnout is broader—emotional exhaustion, detachment, the whole thing. A lot of people have both. What I've seen is that addressing decision fatigue early can prevent the slide into full burnout.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq-question">How long does therapy for decision fatigue take?</h3>
                        <p class="faq-answer">Here's what I've seen: most people start noticing shifts within a few sessions—not because the problems vanish, but because you're relating to them differently. Deeper changes usually take 8-12 sessions. We start practical from session one. Sessions are $175 with insurance receipts.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq-question">Do you offer virtual therapy for decision fatigue?</h3>
                        <p class="faq-answer">Yes, everything is virtual across Ontario. For people dealing with decision fatigue, that matters—no deciding where to park, when to leave, what to wear. One less thing. You show up from wherever you are.</p>
