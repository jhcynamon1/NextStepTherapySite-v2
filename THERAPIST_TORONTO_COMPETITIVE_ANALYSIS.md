### **Section 1: Why Therapy Directories Fail You** (Differentiate)

### **Section 3: What Makes a Good Therapist in Toronto?** (Build authority)

**Credentials Matter**
- CRPO registration (link to registry)
- Ongoing training
- Specialized certifications

**Approach Clarity**
- I use Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
- Evidence-based for anxiety, depression, workplace stress
- Focus on values and committed action

**Personal Fit**
- You should feel heard, not judged
- Therapist should explain their approach clearly
- You should feel hopeful after sessions

**Practical Matters**
- Same-week availability (I offer this)
- Insurance coverage (I provide receipts)
- Virtual or in-person options

### **Section 4: Common Questions About Finding a Therapist in Toronto** (FAQ - capture featured snippets)

**How much does a therapist cost in Toronto?**
$150-$225 per 50-minute session. I charge $175, covered by most
extended health plans.

**Is therapy covered by OHIP in Ontario?**
No, but 80% of employer health plans cover registered psychotherapists.
[Link to full OHIP coverage page]

**How do I know if a therapist is legitimate?**
Check the CRPO registry (I'm CRPO #10979). Avoid anyone not registered
with a professional college.

**What's the difference between a psychologist and psychotherapist?**
Both can provide therapy. Psychologists have PhDs and can do
psychological testing. Psychotherapists have Master's degrees in
counseling. Both are equally effective for therapy.

**How long does it take to find a therapist in Toronto?**
With directories: 2-4 weeks (researching + waitlists)
With me: Book a free consultation within 48 hours

**Should I do virtual or in-person therapy in Toronto?**
Research shows equal effectiveness. Virtual saves commute time/stress.
I offer both.

**How do I know if therapy is working?**
You should notice improvements within 4-6 sessions. If not, discuss
with your therapist or consider trying someone else.
