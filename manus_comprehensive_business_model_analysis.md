# Manus AI: Comprehensive Digital Landlord Business Model Analysis

## Project Background & Context

### **Business Overview**
NextStep Therapy is a virtual psychotherapy practice in Ontario, Canada, operated by Jesse Cynamon (CRPO #10979). The business has evolved from a traditional therapy practice ($3,500/month) into a "Digital Landlord" model targeting $50,000+/month through controlling both supply (therapists) and demand (clients) in Ontario's therapy market.

### **Current Business Status**
- **Revenue:** $3,500/month from direct therapy practice
- **Traffic:** 1,109 monthly impressions, 42 clicks, 0.93% CTR
- **SEO Performance:** 2% AI citation rate vs competitors at 34%
- **Geographic Focus:** Ontario-wide virtual therapy services
- **Regulatory Status:** CRPO compliant, PIPEDA compliant

### **Digital Landlord Model Concept**
Create high-ranking therapy landing pages for specific niches/locations, then lease them to therapists for lead generation. The "rank-first, sell-second" approach builds traffic proof before approaching therapists.
