## STEP 2: Data to Capture (For Each Keyword)

Take a screenshot or note down:

### For Each Keyword:
- ✅ **Search Volume** (monthly searches)
- ✅ **Keyword Difficulty (KD)** (0-100 scale)
- ✅ **Traffic Potential** (if shown)
- ✅ **Parent Topic** (what broader topic does this belong to?)

### Also Check:
- **"Questions" tab** - High-volume questions containing the keyword
- **"Also rank for" tab** - Related keywords we could target on same page
- **"Matching terms"** - Variations and long-tail opportunities

---

## STEP 3: Key Questions to Answer:

1. **What's the search volume?**
   - Is "homesick university" 100 searches? 500? 1,000?
   - Compare to related terms (college, at university, counselling)

2. **What's the Parent Topic?**
   - This is CRITICAL (revealed "therapist near me" for counselling ontario)
   - Could reveal the REAL keyword people search for
   - Might be "student mental health" or "university anxiety"

3. **Is there a bigger market?**
   - Does "student mental health" have 10x more volume?
   - Should we pivot like we did with "student anxiety"?

4. **Competition level:**
   - What's the KD for "homesick university"?
   - We're already Position #5.94 - what does that tell us about difficulty?

5. **Related opportunities:**
   - What shows up in "Also rank for"?
   - Can we capture "homesickness" + "anxiety" + "depression" on same page?

## STEP 4: Screenshot Guidelines

Take screenshots of:

1. **Main keyword overview** for "homesick university" (volume, KD, traffic potential)
2. **Parent Topic** (THIS IS KEY - shows what people actually search)
3. **Questions tab** (top 10 high-volume questions)
4. **"Also rank for" tab** (related keyword opportunities)
5. **Matching terms** (variations we can target)

---

## WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR:

### Best Case Scenario:
- "homesick university" = 300-600 searches (solid niche)
- Parent Topic reveals bigger market (e.g., "student mental health" 5,000 searches)
- Low KD (we're already #5.94, so should be achievable)
- Multiple question keywords we can capture

### Good Case Scenario:
- "homesick university" = 100-300 searches (decent volume)
- Related keywords cluster around 500-1,000 total
- Medium KD (20-35) but we're already ranking
- Clear path to #1-3

### Even If Low Volume:
- Page already has 18.75% CTR (HIGHEST of all pages!)
- Position #5.94 (already Page 1)
- This suggests it's satisfying intent extremely well
- Even 100-200 searches at #1 = valuable traffic

---

## CRITICAL INSIGHT TO VALIDATE:

**Current Performance:**
- Position: #5.94
- CTR: 18.75% (exceptional!)
- This suggests the current page title/meta is VERY compelling

**What to look for in Ahrefs:**
1. What are competitors ranking #1-4 doing differently?
2. What keywords are THEY ranking for that we're missing?
3. Is there a related keyword cluster we should add?
4. What questions show up that we don't answer?

---

## REMEMBER:

**We're already winning** - Position #5.94 with 18.75% CTR!

This isn't a rescue mission like "counselling ontario" (Position #79).

This is a **"push to victory"** optimization:
- Small tweaks to reach #1-3
- Don't break what's already working
- Preserve the compelling title/meta that drives 18.75% CTR
- Add missing elements competitors have

The goal is to understand:
1. Why are we #5.94 instead of #1-3?
2. What small changes move us up?
3. Is there an adjacent market we're missing?

---

## EXPECTED OUTCOME:

After reviewing Ahrefs data + Perplexity research, we'll decide:

1. **Keep current focus** (homesick university) OR **pivot** to larger market
2. **Small optimizations** to preserve 18.75% CTR while moving to #1-3
3. **Additional keywords** to target on same page (hybrid approach)
4. **FAQ questions** to add that competitors are missing
5. **Expected timeline** to reach #1-3 (likely 2-4 weeks, not 6)

This should be our **fastest win yet** because we're starting from Position #5.94!
