# Conversion Optimization Research Prompt for Perplexity

## Context
I'm a registered psychotherapist in Ontario (CRPO #10979) with SEO-optimized therapy pages that generate traffic but have very low conversion rates. Pages are ranking well (some on Page 1) but visitors aren't booking consultations.

**Current Situation:**
- Burlington virtual therapy page: 812 impressions, Position 33, 0% CTR
- First-year university anxiety page: 70 impressions, Position 6 (Page 1), 4.29% CTR
- Pages are 4,000+ words with strong SEO content (FAQs, schema, comprehensive guides)
- Current CTAs: phone number links, contact form, "Book Free Consultation" buttons
- Booking system: Jane App (https://nextsteptherapy.janeapp.com/)
- **Problem:** Very low conversion rate from visitor → consultation booking

**Page Structure:**
- Long-form content (4,000+ words) with problem recognition, solutions, FAQs
- Virtual therapy focus (no physical location)
- Multiple CTAs throughout page (phone, email, contact form)
- Mobile-responsive design with header phone number
- Trust signals: CRPO credentials, insurance info, free consultation offer

## Research Questions

### 1. CTA Strategy for Long-Form Therapy Content
**Question:** What's the optimal CTA strategy for long-form (4,000+ word) healthcare/therapy landing pages that need to maintain SEO value while maximizing conversions?

**Specifically research:**
- How many CTAs should appear on a 4,000-word page?
- Where should CTAs be placed? (Hero, mid-content, after problem recognition, sidebar, floating?)
- Should the primary CTA be "Book Online Now" vs "Free Consultation" vs "Call Now"?
- How do high-converting therapy practices balance educational content with conversion elements?
- What's the ideal hierarchy: online booking > phone > contact form, or different order?

### 2. Online Booking vs. Phone/Contact Form
**Question:** For therapy/mental health services, what converts better: direct online booking links (Jane App, SimplePractice) vs. phone consultation requests vs. contact form submissions?

**Specifically research:**
- Conversion rate data comparing these CTA types in healthcare
- Do anxious clients prefer low-friction online booking or human contact first?
- Should "Free 15-min consultation" come before or after booking request?
- How to reduce booking anxiety for therapy-specific services?
- Best practices from high-converting therapy practices using online booking systems

### 3. Trust & Friction Reduction for Healthcare Bookings
**Question:** What trust signals and friction-reduction techniques are most effective for converting visitors on mental health/therapy landing pages?

**Specifically research:**
- Most effective trust signals for therapy pages (credentials, reviews, insurance info, photos?)
- How to address common objections (cost, privacy, time commitment, "is therapy right for me?")
- Should pricing be transparent or behind consultation request?
- Role of therapist photo/bio in conversion rates
- How to communicate "virtual therapy" as legitimate vs. in-person
- CRPO/licensing display best practices

### 4. Mobile Optimization for Healthcare CTAs
**Question:** What are the mobile-specific conversion optimization strategies for therapy/healthcare landing pages?

**Specifically research:**
- Sticky vs. floating CTA buttons on mobile
- "Click to call" vs. "Book online" priority on mobile devices
- Mobile form optimization (how many fields is too many?)
- Mobile page length considerations (do 4,000-word pages convert on mobile?)
- Thumb-friendly CTA button sizes and placement

### 5. University Student Anxiety Pages (Unique Audience)
**Question:** What conversion strategies work best for university student mental health pages, where the audience is young, budget-conscious, and skeptical of therapy?

**Specifically research:**
- Student-specific trust signals (student insurance, flexible scheduling, confidentiality)
- How to address "will my parents find out?" concern pre-booking
- Pricing presentation for student audiences
- "First-time therapy" messaging that reduces intimidation
- Mobile-first optimization (students primarily mobile users)

### 6. Balancing SEO Content with Conversion Design
**Question:** How do successful healthcare/therapy websites balance long-form SEO content (4,000+ words, FAQs, comprehensive guides) with clean, conversion-focused design?

**Specifically research:**
- Content layout strategies (tabbed sections, collapsible FAQs, sidebar content?)
- Where to place "above the fold" CTA on educational pages
- How to prevent "information overwhelm" while maintaining SEO value
- Progressive disclosure techniques for long-form content
- Case studies of therapy practices with both strong SEO and high conversion rates

### 7. Virtual Therapy Positioning
**Question:** How should virtual-only therapy practices position online sessions as equally legitimate to in-person therapy, and what messaging converts best?

**Specifically research:**
- "Virtual therapy" vs "online therapy" vs "teletherapy" messaging effectiveness
- How to overcome "is video therapy real therapy?" objection
- Benefits messaging that resonates (convenience vs. effectiveness vs. accessibility)
- Video platform concerns and how to address them
- Research citations/stats that build virtual therapy credibility

### 8. Geographic SEO Pages + Conversion
**Question:** For location-specific therapy pages (e.g., "Burlington virtual therapy"), how do top-performing practices balance local SEO with conversion optimization when there's no physical office?

**Specifically research:**
- How virtual-only practices create compelling local pages
- Geographic trust signals that work without physical address
- "Serving [City]" messaging that doesn't feel generic
- Local testimonials/social proof strategies
- How to compete with local in-person practices

### 9. Free Consultation Strategy
**Question:** What's the optimal "free consultation" offer structure for therapy services to maximize booking rates?

**Specifically research:**
- 15-minute vs. 20-minute vs. 30-minute consultation conversion rates
- "Free consultation" vs "Discovery call" vs "Meet your therapist" language
- Phone vs. video for initial consultation (which converts to paid clients better?)
- What information to request before consultation (email only vs. full intake form?)
- How to position consultation (what to expect, what happens next)

### 10. Urgency & Scarcity in Healthcare
**Question:** What urgency/scarcity tactics are ethical and effective for therapy landing pages without being manipulative?

**Specifically research:**
- Limited availability messaging ("3 spots left this week")
- Waitlist strategies
- "Book within 48 hours" approaches
- Seasonal messaging (back-to-school for students, post-holiday anxiety)
- What urgency tactics cross ethical lines in healthcare marketing?
