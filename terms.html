        <h1>Terms of Service & Practice Policies</h1>
        
        <p>Welcome to Next Step Therapy. These terms outline the policies and agreements that govern our therapeutic relationship. By using our services, you agree to these terms.</p>

        <h2>Appointment Cancellations</h2>
        <p>We require 24 hours notice for appointment cancellations. Missed appointments or cancellations with less than 24 hours notice will be charged the full session fee. This policy ensures we can offer the time slot to another client who may be waiting for support.</p>

        <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>Your privacy is paramount. All sessions are confidential in accordance with the Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) and the College of Registered Psychotherapists of Ontario (CRPO) standards. Information is only shared with your written consent, with specific legal exceptions regarding safety and harm.</p>

        <h2>Emergency Services</h2>
        <p>Next Step Therapy is not an emergency service. If you are in crisis or require immediate assistance, please call 911, visit your nearest emergency room, or call a crisis line such as Talk Suicide Canada at 1-833-456-4566.</p>

        <h2>Payment & Insurance</h2>
        <p>Payment is due at the time of the session. We accept major credit cards. Receipts are provided for insurance reimbursement. Please check with your insurance provider to confirm coverage for a "Registered Psychotherapist."</p>

        <h2>Virtual Therapy</h2>
        <p>All sessions are conducted via a secure, PHIPA-compliant video platform. You must be physically located in Ontario at the time of your session due to licensing regulations.</p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about these terms, please contact us at info@nextsteptherapy.ca.</p>
