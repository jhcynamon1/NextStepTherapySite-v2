# Product Requirements Document (PRD): SEO Turnaround & Growth Engine
**Date:** November 2025
**Project:** Next Step Therapy - Organic Growth Acceleration
**Owner:** Jesse Cynamon (CRPO #10979)
**Status:** In Progress (Updated: Nov 18, 2025)

## 1. Executive Summary
Next Step Therapy (nextsteptherapy.ca) is currently underperforming in organic search with a **0.9% CTR** despite ~14,500 monthly impressions. High-intent keywords like "virtual therapy ontario" and "online therapy burlington" are generating thousands of impressions but zero clicks due to "invisible" titles and meta descriptions that fail to connect with the target audience.

This PRD outlines a 30-day aggressive turnaround plan to fix these critical leaks, capitalize on existing impressions, and position the practice as the premium choice for high-functioning professionals in Ontario.

## 2. Core Objectives & KPIs

### Primary Goal: Client Acquisition
*   **Increase Monthly Bookings:** Generate 5-10 new qualified client consultations per month via organic search within 60 days.

### SEO Performance KPIs (30-Day Targets)
*   **CTR Improvement:** Double site-wide CTR from 0.9% to **1.8%+**.
*   **Click Growth:** Increase monthly clicks from ~137 to **250+**.
*   **Ranking:** Move "Virtual Therapy Ontario" from Pos 30+ to **Top 10**.
*   **Conversion:** Capture first clicks/bookings for "Online Therapy Burlington" (currently 0/1,200).

## 3. Target Audience Persona
**The "High-Functioning" Professional**
*   **Demographics:** 25-45, Urban/Suburban Ontario (Toronto, Burlington, Ottawa), Income $80k+.
*   **Psychographics:** Looks successful on the outside but feels exhausted/anxious inside. Struggles with perfectionism, burnout, and "Sunday Night Anxiety."
*   **Pain Points:**
    *   "I don't have time for travel." (Needs virtual)
    *   "I need someone who 'gets' corporate pressure." (Needs relatable expert)
    *   "Is this covered by insurance?" (Needs financial clarity)
*   **Search Behavior:** Searches on mobile, late at night (Sunday/Monday), uses terms like "anxiety therapist near me," "burnout therapy," "adult adhd assessment."

## 4. Critical Feature Requirements (The "Fixes")

### 4.1 Title & Meta Overhaul (The "Click" Engine)
**Status:** ✅ Completed (Nov 18)
**Problem:** Current titles are logistical ("Available This Week") rather than emotional.
**Solution:** Rewrite top 10 pages with high-conversion copy.
*   **Formula:** `[Primary Keyword] | [Emotional Benefit/Specific Condition] | [Trust Signal]`
*   **Example:** `Virtual Therapy Ontario | Anxiety & Stress Support for Professionals`
*   **Scope:** Homepage, Virtual Therapy Ontario, Burlington, Anxiety, Depression pages.

### 4.2 "Near Me" Localization Blocks
**Status:** 🚧 Partial (Footer updated)
**Problem:** Missing out on "Therapist near [City]" traffic without 50 spammy pages.
**Solution:** Inject "Service Area" content blocks into main service pages.
*   **Content:** "Finding Anxiety Therapy Near You in Ontario" section listing key cities (Toronto, Burlington, Ottawa, etc.) with internal links.
*   **Benefit:** Captures local intent signals while maintaining a clean site structure.

### 4.3 Conversion Optimization (UX)
**Status:** ✅ Sticky CTA Implemented
**Problem:** Users land but don't book (Conversion Rate unknown but likely low).
**Solution:**
*   **Sticky Mobile CTA:** "Book Free Call" button fixed to bottom of mobile viewport.
*   **Trust Signals:** Add "CRPO #10979" and "Insurance Accepted" badges above the fold on all landing pages.
*   **Process Transparency:** Add "What to expect in your first session" section to reduce intake anxiety.

### 4.4 Internal Linking Architecture
**Problem:** "Money pages" are buried.
**Solution:**
*   **Footer Expansion:** Redesign footer to include direct links to top 5 service pages and top 5 location pages (creates ~400 sitewide links).
*   **Contextual Linking:** Manually add 10-15 internal links within the body content of high-traffic blog posts pointing to service pages.

## 5. Technical SEO Requirements

### 5.1 Schema Markup
*   **`MedicalWebPage`:** Apply to all Service pages (Anxiety, Depression, etc.).
*   **`FAQPage`:** Add FAQ schema to all core pages to capture "People Also Ask" snippets.
*   **`LocalBusiness` (Virtual):** Ensure "AreaServed" schema covers all target municipalities.

### 5.2 Speed & Performance
*   **Images:** Compress all hero images to WebP format (<100kb).
*   **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** Ensure <2.5s on mobile (Google Core Web Vitals).

## 6. Content Strategy & Roadmap

### 6.1 Immediate Content Gaps (Week 1-2)
*   **"High-Functioning Anxiety" Landing Page:** Target the core persona directly.
*   **"Adult ADHD vs. Anxiety" Blog Post:** Capture informational queries and funnel to booking.
