## How to Use This Guide

### For "Sound Familiar?" Sections:

**Step 1:** Look up the city in this guide
**Step 2:** Pick 4-5 struggles that match the city's REAL economy
**Step 3:** Write scenarios using LOCAL landmarks/employers

### Template:
```
**Sound Familiar?**

- **[Local Industry] Pressure:** [Specific scenario using real employers/highways]
- **[Second Industry] Exhaustion:** [Specific scenario]
- **[Commuter/Parent/Worker type]:** [Scenario with local reference]
- **[Another real struggle]:** [Scenario]
- **[Local-specific pressure]:** [Scenario]

If any of this sounds familiar, you're not weak. You're dealing with real pressures that would affect anyone. The question isn't whether you're strong enough—it's whether you have the right support.

- "Quarterly targets"
- "Performance reviews" (generic)
