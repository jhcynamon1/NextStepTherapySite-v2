## Why These Were Archived

**NOT DELETED** - These files contain important historical context and decisions. They're archived for reference but superseded by:

1. **SEO_MASTER_ARCHIVE.md** - Consolidates all tracking, deployments, and learnings
2. **SEO_PROJECT_STATUS_NOV_4_2025.md** - Current comprehensive status

If you need to reference old decisions or understand historical context, these archived files are still accessible.
