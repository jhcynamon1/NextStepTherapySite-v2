## Budget Breakdown & ROI Projections

### Test Budget Recommendation (Month 1)

**Total Monthly Budget: $2,000 CAD**
**Daily Budget: $66 CAD**

---

### Campaign-Level Budget Allocation

| Campaign | Daily Budget | Monthly Budget | Rationale |
|----------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| Performance Anxiety Therapy Ontario | $26/day | $800/month | PRIMARY: Your specialty, highest conversion potential based on existing SEO performance |
| Therapy for Entrepreneurs Ontario | $20/day | $600/month | SECONDARY: Fits Young Professionals ICP, lower competition |
| Virtual Therapy Ontario | $20/day | $600/month | SECONDARY: Geographic arbitrage opportunity (Ottawa/Hamilton/London) |
| **TOTAL** | **$66/day** | **$2,000/month** | |

---

### Geographic Budget Allocation

**Within Each Campaign:**

| City | % of Campaign Budget | Monthly $ | Rationale |
|------|---------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Ottawa | 40% | $320 per campaign | Highest search volume, Tier 1 expansion city |
| Hamilton | 35% | $280 per campaign | Lower competition, strong opportunity |
| London | 25% | $200 per campaign | Test market, lowest competition |

**Example for Performance Anxiety Campaign ($800/month):**
- Ottawa: $320/month ($10.50/day)
- Hamilton: $280/month ($9.20/day)
- London: $200/month ($6.60/day)

---

### Expected Performance - Month 1 Projections

#### Scenario 1: Conservative (Worst Case)

**Assumptions:**
- Average CPC: $6.00 CAD
- CTR: 1.2%
- Conversion Rate: 12%

**Results:**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Budget | $2,000 |
| Total Clicks | 333 clicks |
| Impressions Needed | ~27,750 |
| Total Conversions | 40 leads |
| **Cost Per Lead** | **$50** |
| **ROI** | **2,800%** |

**Client Economics:**
- 40 leads × 60% booking rate = 24 new clients
- 24 clients × $1,400 CLV = **$33,600 revenue**
- $33,600 - $2,000 ad spend = **$31,600 net**
- **ROAS:** 16.8:1

---

#### Scenario 2: Base Case (Expected)

**Assumptions:**
- Average CPC: $5.00 CAD
- CTR: 1.5%
- Conversion Rate: 15%

**Results:**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Budget | $2,000 |
| Total Clicks | 400 clicks |
| Impressions Needed | ~26,600 |
| Total Conversions | 60 leads |
| **Cost Per Lead** | **$33** |
| **ROI** | **4,200%** |

**Client Economics:**
- 60 leads × 60% booking rate = 36 new clients
- 36 clients × $1,400 CLV = **$50,400 revenue**
- $50,400 - $2,000 ad spend = **$48,400 net**
- **ROAS:** 25.2:1

---

#### Scenario 3: Best Case (If Everything Works)

**Assumptions:**
- Average CPC: $4.00 CAD (great Quality Scores)
- CTR: 2.0%
- Conversion Rate: 20%

**Results:**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Budget | $2,000 |
| Total Clicks | 500 clicks |
| Impressions Needed | ~25,000 |
| Total Conversions | 100 leads |
| **Cost Per Lead** | **$20** |
| **ROI** | **7,000%** |

**Client Economics:**
- 100 leads × 60% booking rate = 60 new clients
- 60 clients × $1,400 CLV = **$84,000 revenue**
- $84,000 - $2,000 ad spend = **$82,000 net**
- **ROAS:** 42:1

---

### Competitor CPC Benchmarks (From Research)

**Based on Ontario Therapy Market Analysis:**

| Keyword Type | Expected CPC Range | Quality Score Target |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| "therapy [city]" | $4.50-7.00 | 6-7 |
| "therapist [city]" | $4.00-6.50 | 6-7 |
| "online therapy [city]" | $3.50-5.50 | 7-8 |
| "performance anxiety therapy" | $5.00-8.00 | 6-7 |
| "entrepreneur therapy" | $3.00-5.00 | 7-9 (low competition) |
| "virtual therapy [city]" | $3.00-5.00 | 7-8 |

**Branded Keywords (After 3-6 months):**
| Keyword | Expected CPC | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| "next step therapy" | $0.50-1.50 | Very low, defensive campaign |
| "nextsteptherapy" | $0.30-1.00 | Even lower |

---

### Industry Conversion Rate Benchmarks

**Healthcare/Therapy Practices (2024 Data):**
- **Top Performers:** 20-30% (excellent landing pages, strong offer)
- **Average:** 10-15% (decent landing pages)
- **Poor Performers:** 5-10% (generic landing pages, no clear CTA)

**Your Conversion Rate Predictions:**
- **Phone Calls:** 18-22% (people call when ready to book)
- **Jane Bookings:** 12-16% (more steps involved)
- **Combined:** 15-20% overall

**Why Your Conversion Rate Should Be Higher Than Average:**
✅ CRPO registration visible (builds trust)
✅ "Available This Week" messaging (urgency)
✅ Free consultation offer (reduces friction)
✅ Virtual therapy (convenience)
✅ Existing strong SEO content (authority)

---

### Break-Even Analysis

**Your Session Economics:**
- Session Price: $175
- Sessions Per Client: 8 (industry average)
- **Client Lifetime Value:** $1,400

**Break-Even Cost Per Acquisition:**
- To break even, CPA must be <$1,400
- **Comfortable CPA Target:** <$200 (7:1 ROI)
- **Aggressive CPA Target:** <$100 (14:1 ROI)

**What This Means:**
- Even if your CPA is $200, you make $1,200 profit per client
- At 30 clients from $2,000 spend, that's $36,000 net profit
- **Your margin is HUGE, giving you room to test and optimize**

---

### Payback Period Calculation

**Scenario: $2,000 ad spend, 36 new clients (base case)**

| Month | Revenue | Cumulative Revenue | Cumulative Profit |
|-------|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1 | $6,300 (36 clients × 1 session avg) | $6,300 | $4,300 |
| 2 | $12,600 (36 × 2 sessions) | $18,900 | $16,900 |
| 3 | $18,900 (36 × 3 sessions) | $37,800 | $35,800 |
| 6 | $37,800 (36 × 6 sessions) | $75,600 | $73,600 |

**Payback Period:** Within 1 month (first $2,000 recovered after 11-12 clients book first session)
