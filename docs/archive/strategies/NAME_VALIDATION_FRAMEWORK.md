# Therapy Practice Name Validation Framework

## Purpose
Systematic evaluation framework to pressure-test potential names against research findings, business objectives, and market reality.

---

## VALIDATION FRAMEWORK: 10 Critical Tests

### TEST 1: THE SYLLABLE TEST (Linguistic Efficiency)
**Question**: How many syllables? Is it easy to say?

**Research Benchmark**:
- Top performers: 2-3 syllables (Psych Company, Shift Collab, Hard Feelings)
- User preference: Next Step (2), Straight Up (2)

**Scoring**:
- 2 syllables: 10/10
- 3 syllables: 8/10
- 4 syllables: 5/10
- 5+ syllables: 2/10

**Why it matters**: Shorter = more memorable, easier word-of-mouth, better for verbal referrals

---

### TEST 2: THE DIFFERENTIATION TEST (Market Positioning)
**Question**: Does it escape the saturated patterns?

**Research Benchmarks**:
- ❌ Avoid: 50.6% metaphorical (nature, journey, wellness)
- ❌ Avoid: 20.8% generic geographic
- ✅ Target: 11.7% professional/functional white space

**Scoring**:
- Completely unique approach: 10/10
- Sits in white space: 8/10
- Similar to successful outliers: 6/10
- Sounds like 20-50% of market: 3/10
- Sounds like 50%+ of market: 0/10

**Test**: Google "[name] therapy" - how many similar names appear?

---

### TEST 3: THE MULTI-THERAPIST SIGNAL TEST
**Question**: Does it clearly indicate you're NOT a solo practitioner?

**Research Benchmarks**:
- Strong signals: "Group," "Collective," "Associates," "Co."
- Weak signals: "Practice," "Therapy," "Clinic" (could be solo)
- No signal: Single word names

**Scoring**:
- Explicit team indicator (Group/Collective): 10/10
- Implicit team indicator (Co./Associates): 8/10
- Could be interpreted either way: 5/10
- Reads as solo: 2/10

**Why it matters**: Local SEO competitors have multi-therapist scale advantage

---

### TEST 4: THE "MOM TEST" (Clarity)
**Question**: If you told your mom the name, would she know what you do?

**Test Scenarios**:
- "I'm starting a company called [NAME]"
- "What do you think I do?"
- Does she say "therapy" without prompting?

**Scoring**:
- Immediately obvious (includes Therapy/Psychology/Counselling): 10/10
- Obvious with context: 7/10
- Requires explanation: 4/10
- Confusing/misleading: 0/10

**Why it matters**: Word-of-mouth referrals, Google search clarity

---

### TEST 5: THE ICP RESONANCE TEST
**Question**: Does it appeal to ALL THREE ICPs without alienating any?

**Your ICPs**:
1. Young Professionals (25-35): Want modern, efficient, trustworthy
2. University Students (18-24): Want approachable, not intimidating
3. Men in High-Stress Careers (30-45): Want direct, no-BS, serious

**Scoring Method**:
Rate each ICP 1-10, then average:
- All three 7+: Pass (score = average)
- One ICP below 6: Concern (flag risk)
- One ICP below 5: Fail (alienates segment)

**Why it matters**: You can't afford to alienate any of your three revenue streams

---

### TEST 6: THE GBP TEST (Local SEO Strategy)
**Question**: Does it work with city modifiers?

**Test**: Say these out loud:
- "[Name] - Toronto"
- "[Name] - Ottawa"
- "[Name] - Waterloo"

**Scoring**:
- Sounds like established local clinic: 10/10
- Works but slightly redundant: 7/10
- Feels weird/awkward: 4/10
- Doesn't work: 0/10

**Why it matters**: Your entire growth strategy depends on GBP local feel

---

### TEST 7: THE DOMAIN TEST (Digital Viability)
**Question**: Can you get a good domain?

**Hierarchy** (in order of importance for you):
1. .ca available (critical for Ontario local trust)
2. Clean domain (no hyphens, numbers, extra words)
3. Short domain (under 15 characters ideal)
4. .com available (nice to have, protects brand)

**Scoring**:
- Perfect .ca available + short: 10/10
- .ca available, slightly long: 8/10
- .ca taken but alternative works: 5/10
- Only hyphenated .ca available: 3/10
- No good .ca option: 0/10

**Test it**: Go to godaddy.ca or namecheap.com and search

---

### TEST 8: THE TRADEMARK TEST (Legal Viability)
**Question**: Can you actually own this name?

**Red Flags**:
- Too descriptive ("Main Therapy," "Local Psychology")
- Common phrases ("Clear Path," "New Start")
- Similar to major competitors in health/wellness

**Scoring**:
- Highly distinctive, likely trademarkable: 10/10
- Moderately distinctive: 7/10
- Borderline descriptive: 5/10
- Likely too generic: 2/10

**Preliminary test**: Search Canadian Trademarks Database (ised-isde.canada.ca)

---

### TEST 9: THE AESTHETIC/GUT TEST (Does it feel like YOU?)
**Question**: Does it match your actual vibe and values?

**Your stated preferences**:
- ✅ Pragmatic, direct (like "Next Step," "Straight Up Health")
- ✅ Professional but not corporate
- ✅ Serious but not intimidating
- ❌ NOT fluffy, metaphorical, trying too hard
- ❌ NOT startup-y, tech-forward unless natural

**Scoring**:
- "This IS us": 10/10
- "I could see it": 7/10
- "Meh, it's fine": 5/10
- "This doesn't feel right": 2/10

**Why it matters**: You'll be saying this name thousands of times. If it doesn't feel authentic, you'll resent it.

---

### TEST 10: THE LONGEVITY TEST (10-Year Vision)
**Question**: Does this still work at scale?

**Scenarios**:
- 50+ therapists across Ontario
- Multiple physical locations
- Potential expansion beyond Ontario
- Potential services beyond therapy (coaching, assessments)

**Scoring**:
- Works perfectly at any scale: 10/10
- Works well, minor limitations: 7/10
- Gets awkward at scale: 4/10
- Locks you into current model: 2/10

**Why it matters**: Rebranding again in 3 years would be expensive and damaging

## WORKED EXAMPLE: "SESSION GROUP"

Let me score this to show you WHY it might not feel right:

| Test | Weight | Score | Weighted | Analysis |
|------|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| 1. Syllables | 15% | 8/10 | 1.2 | 3 syllables - good but not great |
| 2. Differentiation | 15% | 7/10 | 1.05 | Functional space but "Group" is common |
| 3. Multi-Therapist | 10% | 10/10 | 1.0 | "Group" is crystal clear |
| 4. Clarity | 10% | 7/10 | 0.7 | "Session" clear, but what kind of sessions? |
| 5. ICP Resonance | 15% | 7/10 | 1.05 | YP: 7, Students: 7, Men: 7 (balanced but uninspiring) |
| 6. GBP Local | 10% | 8/10 | 0.8 | "Session Group - Toronto" works |
| 7. Domain | 10% | 8/10 | 0.8 | SessionGroup.ca likely available |
| 8. Trademark | 5% | 6/10 | 0.3 | "Session Group" borderline descriptive |
| 9. Gut Feel | 5% | 5/10 | 0.25 | **YOU SAID: "doesn't quite feel right"** |
| 10. Longevity | 5% | 8/10 | 0.4 | Scales well |
| **TOTAL** | 100% | | **72.5/100** | **VIABLE but not excellent** |

**Why it doesn't feel right**:
- It's **safe but boring**
- Checks functional boxes but has no **personality**
- "Group" is the 10th most common word in therapy naming
- Feels like it was designed by committee

## WHAT TO DO NEXT

### OPTION 1: Use this framework to test other names
Run 5-10 candidates through this scorecard systematically

### OPTION 2: Identify what's ACTUALLY most important to you
Rank these 10 tests by importance. What would you sacrifice for what?

Example:
- If Gut Feel is MOST important: Accept trade-offs on other criteria
- If Differentiation is MOST important: Accept that it might be slightly less clear

### OPTION 3: Generate new names optimized for YOUR top priorities
Once you tell me what you weight highest, I can generate names specifically for that

---

## THE HARD TRUTH

You might be trying to optimize for **too many things**:
- Short syllables
- Multi-therapist signal
- Differentiation
- Clarity
- Appeals to 3 different ICPs
- Feels pragmatic/direct
- Works with session.me
- Professional but approachable
- Local feel at scale

**Some of these conflict with each other.**

**The question is: What are you willing to sacrifice?**

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Score "Session Group" yourself** using this framework - see if my scores match yours
2. **Tell me your top 3 most important criteria** - what MUST the name do?
3. **Tell me what you're willing to compromise on** - what's negotiable?

Then I can generate 5-10 names optimized for what actually matters to YOU, not what AI thinks is best.
