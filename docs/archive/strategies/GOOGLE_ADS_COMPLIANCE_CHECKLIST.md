# Google Ads Implementation Plan - Compliance & Checklists
**Part 4 of Complete Implementation Plan (FINAL)**

---

## Risk Mitigation & Compliance

### Common PPC Pitfalls for Therapy Practices (and How to Avoid Them)

#### Pitfall 1: Overspending Due to Broad Match Keywords
**The Mistake:**
Using broad match keywords like `therapy` or `anxiety treatment` without negative keywords.

**The Impact:**
- Budget exhausted in hours
- Ads shown for "therapy jobs", "therapy dog training", "free therapy tips"
- 50-70% wasted spend

**How to Avoid:**
✅ Use phrase match or exact match only
✅ Build comprehensive negative keyword list (75+ terms) BEFORE launch
✅ Check search terms report daily for first week

---

#### Pitfall 2: Sending All Traffic to Homepage
**The Mistake:**
Running "ADHD therapy Toronto" ads but sending clicks to your generic homepage.

**The Impact:**
- Conversion rate drops from 20% to 5%
- Users have to hunt for ADHD information
- High bounce rate, low Quality Score

**How to Avoid:**
✅ Create specific landing pages for each ad group theme
✅ OR use existing service pages (performance-anxiety-therapy-ontario.html)
✅ Ensure headline on landing page matches ad headline

---

#### Pitfall 3: No Conversion Tracking = Flying Blind
**The Mistake:**
Launching campaigns without setting up phone call + form submission tracking.

**The Impact:**
- Can't tell which keywords/ads are generating leads
- Continue spending on non-converting campaigns
- No data to make optimization decisions

**How to Avoid:**
✅ Set up conversion tracking BEFORE launching campaigns (Task 1.3-1.4)
✅ Test conversion tracking with manual clicks
✅ Verify conversions appear in both Google Ads AND GA4

---

#### Pitfall 4: Violating CRPO Advertising Guidelines
**The Mistake:**
Using outcome-based claims: "Cure your anxiety", "Guaranteed results", "Best therapist in Toronto".

**The Impact:**
- Ads disapproved by Google
- Potential CRPO complaint
- Violation of professional standards

**How to Avoid:**
✅ Use process language: "May help with", "Work through", "Evidence-based approaches"
✅ Never guarantee outcomes
✅ Always display CRPO # in ads and landing pages
✅ See full compliance checklist below

---

#### Pitfall 5: Ignoring Mobile Users
**The Mistake:**
Creating landing pages optimized for desktop only, ignoring that 60-70% of therapy searches are mobile.

**The Impact:**
- High mobile bounce rate
- Poor mobile conversion rate
- Wasted ad spend on mobile clicks

**How to Avoid:**
✅ Test landing pages on mobile BEFORE launching ads
✅ Use click-to-call phone links (tel: format)
✅ Ensure CTA buttons are 44px+ height
✅ Keep forms short (3-5 fields max on mobile)

---

#### Pitfall 6: Setting "Fire and Forget" Campaigns
**The Mistake:**
Launching campaigns, then not checking them for weeks.

**The Impact:**
- Wasting thousands on irrelevant search terms
- Missing opportunities to optimize
- Poor performance vs competitors who actively manage

**How to Avoid:**
✅ Daily 15-minute check for first 7 days
✅ Weekly 1-hour optimization sessions (Weeks 2-4)
✅ Set up automated alerts for budget exhaustion, disapproved ads

---

#### Pitfall 7: Competing with Your Own SEO
**The Mistake:**
Running PPC ads for keywords you already rank #1 organically.

**The Impact:**
- Paying for clicks you would've gotten free
- Cannibalization of organic traffic
- Wasted ad spend

**How to Avoid:**
✅ Check your organic rankings for target keywords BEFORE adding to PPC
✅ Focus PPC on keywords where you rank #4-20 (not #1-3)
✅ Use Google Search Console to see which keywords drive organic traffic
✅ Reserve PPC for:
   - New keywords with no organic ranking
   - High-competition keywords where you rank on page 2+
   - Geographic markets you're expanding into (Ottawa, Hamilton, London)

**Example Decision Matrix:**
| Keyword | Organic Rank | PPC Decision |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| "performance anxiety therapy ontario" | #3 | ❌ Skip PPC, already ranking well |
| "performance anxiety therapy ottawa" | #12 | ✅ Add to PPC, page 2 rank |
| "entrepreneur therapy hamilton" | Not ranked | ✅ Add to PPC, no organic presence |
| "virtual therapy ontario" | #1 | ❌ Skip PPC, already #1 |

---

#### Pitfall 8: Poor Quality Score from Day 1
**The Mistake:**
Not optimizing ad copy and landing page relevance before launch.

**The Impact:**
- Starting with QS 3-4 instead of 6-7
- Paying 50% more per click than necessary
- Low ad position despite high bids

**How to Avoid:**
✅ Include target keyword in ad headline (e.g., "Performance Anxiety Therapy Ottawa")
✅ Ensure landing page H1 matches ad headline
✅ Add keyword to landing page URL path (nextsteptherapy.ca/performance-anxiety/)
✅ Write ads that are SPECIFIC to ad group keywords (not generic "therapy" ads)

---

#### Pitfall 9: No Budget Safeguards
**The Mistake:**
No daily budget caps, shared budgets across all campaigns, or no alerts.

**The Impact:**
- Budget exhausted in days instead of full month
- Unable to gather full 30 days of data
- Emergency campaign pausing mid-month

**How to Avoid:**
✅ Set campaign-level daily budgets (not account-level)
✅ Set up budget alerts at 50%, 80%, 100% spend
✅ Never use "Accelerated" delivery (always use "Standard")
✅ Review budget pacing every 2-3 days

---

#### Pitfall 10: Testing Too Many Variables at Once
**The Mistake:**
Launching 10 campaigns, 30 ad groups, 150 keywords, and 5 landing pages simultaneously.

**The Impact:**
- Can't tell what's working or why
- Not enough data per campaign to optimize
- Overwhelmed with data, paralyzed by analysis

**How to Avoid:**
✅ Start with 3 campaigns max (Month 1)
✅ 3 ad groups per campaign (9 total)
✅ 8-12 keywords per ad group (90 total)
✅ 3 ads per ad group (27 total ads)
✅ Use existing landing pages, don't create new ones yet
✅ Master the basics, THEN expand

---

---

### Required Disclosures

**On Every Ad:**
✅ CRPO registration number (CRPO #10979)
✅ Professional title ("Psychotherapist" OR "Registered Psychotherapist")

**On Every Landing Page:**
✅ CRPO registration number prominently displayed
✅ Your full name and credentials
✅ Privacy statement link (PHIPA compliance)
✅ Fee information (or "fees vary, free consultation available")
✅ Geographic areas served
✅ Cancellation policy (if booking online)

**On Jane App Booking:**
✅ Informed consent form
✅ Privacy policy
✅ Fee agreement
✅ Cancellation policy (24-48 hour notice)

---

### Privacy Considerations (PHIPA Compliance)

**Google Ads Pixel & Tracking:**
✅ **Allowed:** Tracking clicks, page views, button clicks
✅ **Allowed:** Tracking conversion events (booking_click, phone_call)
❌ **NOT Allowed:** Passing client personal information to Google Ads
❌ **NOT Allowed:** Using client email lists for remarketing

**Remarketing:**
✅ **Allowed:** Showing ads to people who visited your site (generic therapy ads)
❌ **NOT Allowed:** Showing ads referencing specific issues they viewed (e.g., "Still struggling with anxiety?")
❌ **NOT Allowed:** Remarketing to people who booked appointments (they're now clients, not prospects)

**Recommended Remarketing Setup:**
- Create audience: "All website visitors (last 30 days)"
- Exclude: "Thank you page visitors" (people who booked)
- Ad copy: Generic (e.g., "Ontario Therapy Services | CRPO Registered")
- Never reference specific pages they visited

---

### Record-Keeping Requirements

**What to Log:**
1. **Ad Copy Archive:** Save all ad variations with dates launched/paused
2. **Landing Page Archives:** Screenshot landing pages monthly
3. **Conversion Data:** Maintain log of all leads generated from ads
4. **Search Terms Reports:** Export weekly, keep for 1 year
5. **Budget Tracking:** Monthly spend reports

**Why:**
- CRPO may request advertising materials during audit
- Helps defend against complaints ("Our ad said 'may help', not 'cure'")
- Required for business tax purposes (ad spend records)

---

## Budget Protection Strategies

### Daily Budget Safeguards

**1. Set Campaign-Level Daily Budgets**
```
Campaign 1: $26/day
Campaign 2: $20/day
Campaign 3: $20/day
```

**Do NOT use:**
- Shared budget across campaigns (you lose control)
- Account-level budget (same issue)

---

**2. Set Up Budget Alerts**

In Google Ads:
1. Go to Tools → "Alert Center"
2. Create custom alert:
   - Alert type: "Budget pacing"
   - Trigger: When campaign spends 50% of monthly budget
   - Also create alerts at 80% and 100%
3. Send alerts to: Your email + SMS

---

**3. Use Standard Delivery (Not Accelerated)**

**Standard Delivery:**
- Spreads budget evenly throughout the day
- Shows ads consistently from 9am-9pm
- Prevents budget exhaustion by 2pm

**Accelerated Delivery (DON'T USE):**
- Spends budget as fast as possible
- Can exhaust daily budget in 1-2 hours
- Only for limited-time offers

---

**4. Monitor Budget Pacing Every 2-3 Days**

**Expected Pacing:**
| Day of Month | Expected Spend | % of Monthly Budget |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Day 5 | $330 | 16.5% |
| Day 10 | $660 | 33% |
| Day 15 | $990 | 49.5% |
| Day 20 | $1,320 | 66% |
| Day 25 | $1,650 | 82.5% |
| Day 30 | $2,000 | 100% |

**If you're ahead of pace:**
- Reduce bids by 10-20%
- Pause lowest-performing ad groups
- Add more negative keywords

**If you're behind pace:**
- Increase bids by 10-20%
- Expand keyword match types (phrase → broad)
- Extend ad schedule hours

---

### Negative Keyword Maintenance Schedule

**Daily (First 7 Days):**
- Check search terms report
- Add 2-5 negative keywords per day

**Weekly (Weeks 2-4):**
- Download search terms report
- Add 5-10 negatives per week
- Review negative keyword list for overly restrictive terms

**Monthly (Month 2+):**
- Audit full negative keyword list
- Remove negatives that are too broad
- Add industry-standard negatives you missed

**Goal: 150-200 negative keywords by end of Month 1**

---

### Alert Thresholds for Poor Performance

**Set Up These Automated Alerts:**

| Metric | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| CTR drops below | 1.0% | Review ad copy, pause worst ads |
| CPC increases above | $8.00 | Reduce bids, check Quality Score |
| Daily spend exceeds | $75 (110% of budget) | Emergency pause, check for click fraud |
| Conversion rate drops below | 10% | Check landing pages, review search terms |
| Cost per conversion exceeds | $250 | Pause campaigns, analyze data |

**How to Create Alerts:**
1. Google Ads → Tools → Rules
2. Create custom rules for each threshold
3. Set to check daily
4. Email + SMS notification
