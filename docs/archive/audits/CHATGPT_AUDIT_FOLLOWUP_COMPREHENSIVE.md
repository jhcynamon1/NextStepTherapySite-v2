2. **Leverage low-competition goldmines** - "mental health" and "counselling" have massive volume with LOW competition
3. **Seasonal opportunities** - Anxiety therapy peaks in spring (April/May), couples therapy peaks in summer
4. **Virtual positioning** - "virtual therapy across ontario" differentiates from city-limited competitors

- Any recommendations involving testimonials or comparative claims are non-starters

---

### 5. **Analytics Insights - Specific Pain Points**

**High Bounce Rate Pages (Need Investigation):**
- Unknown - we don't have bounce rate data readily available
- **Request:** Can you check Google Analytics for pages with >70% bounce rate?

**Low Dwell Time Pages:**
- Unknown - need Analytics access to confirm
- **Request:** Which pages have average session duration <30 seconds?

**Conversion Funnel Issues:**
- Jane App booking link: https://nextsteptherapy.janeapp.com/

- **Request:** Are users clicking CTAs but not booking? (Check GA events)

**Traffic Sources:**
- Primarily organic search (95%+)
- Minimal referral traffic (indicates no backlinks)
- No social media traffic (CRPO compliance limits social)

## 📊 ADDITIONAL CONTEXT FOR DEEPER ANALYSIS

### **Site History & Context**

**August 2025:** Deployed 100+ programmatic pages
- Result: Traffic spiked to 341 impressions/day briefly
- Then: Google deindexed most pages, traffic crashed to 85/day

**September 2025:** Algorithm Updates Hit
- September "Perspective" Core Update (Sept 12-26)
- YMYL definition updates (Sept 11)
- August Spam Update (ongoing)
- Our site got caught in quality filter

**October 2025:** 3 Months of Intensive SEO Work
- ✅ Fixed 48 pages with schema errors
- ✅ Fixed www vs non-www canonical issues (706 pages)
- ✅ Optimized 10+ high-priority pages with data-driven keywords
- ✅ Added FAQ schema to major pages
- ✅ Fixed 70+ 404 errors with 301 redirects
- ✅ Removed 212 broken internal links
- ✅ Conversion optimization (Jane App, CTAs, mobile sticky bars)

**Result:** Traffic FLAT at 110-150 impressions/day (no improvement)

**October 19, 2025:** Brief spike to 450 impressions
- Lasted 2-3 days
- Crashed back to 110-150/day
- Hypothesis: Google briefly tried to re-index our content, hit technical issues (duplicate URLs?), gave up

### **Competitive Landscape**

**Who We're Competing Against:**

1. **Psychology Today** (psychologytoday.com)
   - Huge therapist directory
   - Thousands of backlinks
   - Domain Authority: 90+
   - Dominates "find a therapist" queries

2. **FirstSession** (firstsession.com)
   - Canadian therapy marketplace
   - Strong local presence
   - Multiple city pages
   - Directory model

3. **Local Private Practice Websites**
   - Individual therapists with established practices
   - Often have 5-10 years of backlink history
   - Strong local SEO (Google Business Profiles)
   - Client relationships = natural backlinks

4. **Virtual Therapy Platforms**
   - BetterHelp (betterhelp.com)
   - Talkspace (talkspace.com)
   - National brands with huge marketing budgets

**We're David vs Multiple Goliaths** - but we have advantages:
- CRPO compliance expertise (can educate)
- Virtual-first positioning (no geographic limits)
- Specialized niches (workplace stress, university students, men's mental health)
- Personal brand (Jesse Cynamon, not corporate)

### **What Makes This Audit Unique**

**This is NOT a typical therapy website:**
- Solo practitioner (not a group practice or directory)
- Virtual-only (no physical office)
- Ontario-wide service area (not city-specific)
- CRPO-regulated (stricter than most jurisdictions)
- Tech-forward (direct Jane App integration, modern conversion optimization)

**Key Differentiators to Preserve:**
- Professional, evidence-based positioning (not "woo-woo" therapy)
- Accessibility focus (virtual removes barriers)
- Workplace stress specialization (underserved niche)
- Male-friendly messaging (men's mental health gap)
