# How to Clear Favicon Cache

Your browser is aggressively caching the old favicon. Here's how to force the update:

## Method 1: Chrome/Edge (Recommended)

2. Open Chrome DevTools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
3. Right-click the refresh button
4. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
5. Or: chrome://settings/clearBrowserData
   - Time range: "All time"
   - Check only: "Cached images and files"
   - Click "Clear data"
6. Close browser completely
7. Reopen and visit site

## Method 2: Safari
1. Safari → Settings → Privacy → Manage Website Data
2. Search for "nextsteptherapy.ca"
3. Remove
4. Close Safari completely
5. Reopen and visit site

## Method 3: Firefox
1. Ctrl+Shift+Delete (or Cmd+Shift+Delete)
2. Select "Cache"
3. Click "Clear Now"
4. Close Firefox
5. Reopen and visit site

## Method 4: Nuclear Option (If Nothing Works)
Visit this direct link to force-load the new favicon:

Then visit your homepage.

## Verify It's Fixed
The favicon should be a clean square logo centered on white, NOT stretched/warped.

## Why Is This So Hard?
Browsers cache favicons VERY aggressively (sometimes for weeks) to save bandwidth. 
Even "hard refresh" doesn't always clear it.
