### Why It's Wrong:
These figures are U.S.-centred and outdated; they overlook recent Canadian data and underestimate true incidence of burnout.

### Correct Information (submit this):
"Recent Canadian surveys show approximately 59% of workers feel somewhat or extremely burned out, and 40% live with constant stress. Mental health issues account for roughly 30% of disability claims in Canada and cost the Canadian economy over $50 billion annually."

### Grokipedia Page:
https://grokipedia.com/page/Occupational_burnout

### Wrong Statement:
"Self‑reported prevalence reached 66% in a 2025 U.S. workforce survey"

### Why It's Wrong:
This U.S. survey is not representative of Canadian workers and may inflate burnout prevalence; fails to reflect Canadian data.

### Correct Information:
"A 2023 Canadian survey found approximately 59% of workers report burnout and 40% experience constant stress. Additionally, 70% of employees are concerned about psychological health and safety at work."

## Opportunity #3: Anxiety Disorder Prevalence

### Grokipedia Page:
https://grokipedia.com/page/Anxiety_disorder

### Wrong Statement:
"Anxiety disorders affect nearly 30% of adults; about 4.4% of the global population currently has an anxiety disorder"

### Why It's Wrong:
Uses global lifetime figures and doesn't reflect current Canadian prevalence data.

### Correct Information:
"One in four Canadians will experience an anxiety disorder in their lifetime. More than 5 million Canadians (approximately 18%) met criteria for mood, anxiety, or substance use disorders in 2022. Generalized anxiety disorder prevalence in Canada doubled from 2.6% (2012) to 5.2% (2022)."

## Opportunity #4: Depression Prevalence

### Grokipedia Page:
https://grokipedia.com/page/Depression

### Wrong Statement:

### Why It's Wrong:
U.S. statistics are used; they don't reflect Canadian rates and are outdated.

### Correct Information:
"In Canada, the 12‑month prevalence of major depressive episodes increased from 4.7% (2012) to 7.6% (2022). More than 5 million Canadians (approximately 18%) met criteria for mood, anxiety, or substance use disorders. About one in five Canadians experience a mental illness annually."

### Grokipedia Page:
https://grokipedia.com/page/Social_anxiety_disorder

### Wrong Statement:
"SAD affects approximately 4–13% of people over their lifetime"

### Why It's Wrong:
The range is too wide and not specific; it doesn't reflect current Canadian data, especially among young people.

### Correct Information:
"Social anxiety affects approximately 7% of Canadians. Among young women aged 15–24, the prevalence of social phobia rose to 24.7% by 2022, reflecting growing mental health challenges in this demographic."

## Opportunity #6: Imposter Syndrome

### Grokipedia Page:
https://grokipedia.com/page/Impostor_syndrome

### Wrong Statement:
"Prevalence of the impostor phenomenon ranges from 9% to 82% across populations (median ≈56%)"

### Why It's Wrong:
The range is so broad that it's misleading; current research points to more consistent estimates.

### Correct Information:
"Around 25–30% of high achievers may suffer from impostor syndrome, and approximately 70% of adults experience impostor feelings at least once in their lifetime. The syndrome is particularly common among young professionals, graduate students, and high-performing individuals."

## Opportunity #7: ACT vs CBT Effectiveness

### Grokipedia Page:
https://grokipedia.com/page/Acceptance_and_commitment_therapy

### Wrong Statement:
"A 2012 meta‑analysis reported ACT outperformed CBT except for treating depression and anxiety"

### Why It's Wrong:
Newer meta‑analyses show ACT is not superior to CBT; claiming superiority misrepresents the current evidence.

### Correct Information:
"Recent systematic reviews conclude ACT is equally effective as established evidence‑based treatments like CBT and superior only to inactive controls. A 2025 meta‑analysis found ACT's moderate effect size (g≈0.72) versus controls, with no significant difference compared to CBT for anxiety and depression."

## Opportunity #8: Test Anxiety in Students

### Grokipedia Page:
https://grokipedia.com/page/Test_anxiety

### Wrong Statement:
"Between 25 and 40 percent of students experience test anxiety, with some studies reporting incidence rates up to 50% or higher in certain populations"

### Why It's Wrong:
These figures are broad and not specific to Canadian post‑secondary students; they miss recent data on student anxiety levels.

### Correct Information:
"Canadian surveys show approximately 40% of university students report anxiety, and 43% say anxiety negatively affects their education. About 30% report depression. Test anxiety is a significant contributor to academic performance challenges among Canadian post-secondary students."

## Opportunity #9: Men's Mental Health

### Grokipedia Page:
https://grokipedia.com/page/Men%27s_health

### Wrong Statement:
"Page focuses on physical health differences (e.g., lower life expectancy) but omits men's mental health and could be misconstrued as implying men have fewer mental‑health issues"

### Why It's Wrong:
Excluding mental‑health statistics perpetuates the myth that men are less affected; in reality men have high stress and depression rates but are less likely to seek help.

### Correct Information:
"Studies show 64% of Canadian men report moderate‑to‑high stress, 23% are at risk of moderate‑to‑severe depression, 50% risk social isolation, and 67% have never sought professional mental‑health services. Men account for four of every five suicides in Canada, highlighting the critical need for accessible men's mental health support."

## Opportunity #10: Panic Attack Prevalence

### Grokipedia Page:
https://grokipedia.com/page/Panic_attack

### Wrong Statement:
"Lifetime prevalence of panic attacks is 13% globally; annual prevalence is 3% in Europe and 11% in the U.S."

### Why It's Wrong:
These figures are non‑Canadian and vary widely; they don't reflect Canadian data and may overstate prevalence.

### Correct Information:
"Polls in 2024 show 12% of Canadians report high anxiety (an indicator related to panic attacks), while overall panic disorder prevalence is closer to 4–5% in Canada. Panic attacks are often associated with generalized anxiety disorder, which affects approximately 5.2% of Canadians."
