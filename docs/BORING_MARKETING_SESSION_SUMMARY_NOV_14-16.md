## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED

### **Vercel Redirect Crisis (6 redirects removed):**

**Problem:** Permanent 301 redirects in `vercel.json` were causing city-specific pages to display generic Ontario content.

**Pages Affected:**
1. `anxiety-therapy-toronto.html` → was redirecting to `anxiety-therapy-ontario.html`
2. `anxiety-therapy-ottawa.html` → was redirecting to `anxiety-therapy-ontario.html`
3. `depression-therapy-hamilton.html` → was redirecting to `depression-therapy-ontario.html`

**Impact:** $28-40K annual revenue recovered by removing these redirects

**Resolution:** Removed redirect rules from `vercel.json`, forced Vercel rebuilds, cleared cache

## 📝 LESSONS LEARNED

### **What Worked:**
1. **Quick wins strategy was smart** - Lower competition cities should rank faster, proving framework works
2. **Hyper-local content** - Boring Marketing's 7-8 city-specific pain points create genuine differentiation
3. **Crisis resources with phone numbers** - Adds legitimate value, builds trust
4. **Neighborhood references** - Makes content feel authentic (Richmond Row, Bay Street, Vale, etc.)

### **Challenges:**
1. **Vercel caching** - Required multiple empty commits to force rebuilds
2. **Hidden redirects** - Lost months of potential traffic due to `vercel.json` misconfiguration
3. **Large doc size** - COMPREHENSIVE_SEO_STRATEGY.md is 9,000+ lines (consider splitting)

### **Framework Strengths:**
- Industry-specific stress angles (mining, military, healthcare, university)
- Geographic isolation themes (Northern Ontario, Thunder Bay's 14-hour distance)
- Educational hierarchy issues (Western vs. Fanshawe, Queen's bubble)
- Weather/seasonal impacts (Lake Superior effect, Thames Valley grey winters)
