1. **Homepage** (7/10) - Hero formula different but effective, strong pain point resonance

## 🎯 KEY INSIGHTS

### 1. Local SEO is the Goldmine
**Framework's emphasis on city-specific content is where existing pages are weakest and where Google rewards most.**

Action: Prioritize "Understanding [CITY] Professional Life" sections on ALL Tier 1 cities.

### 2. Ottawa is Emergency Priority
**Ottawa anxiety page is completely generic (duplicate content). Losing massive traffic opportunity.**

Action: Week 1, Monday-Tuesday. Non-negotiable.

### 3. Framework Needs CRPO Adaptation
**Framework testimonials lack proper attribution required by CRPO.**

Action: Create testimonial workflow before implementation. All testimonials need: first name + initial + context.

### 4. Don't Standardize What's Working
**Homepage and workplace-stress pages performing well with different structure.**

Action: Only implement low-priority fixes, A/B test changes. Framework is guide, not mandate.

### 5. The "Local Connection" Section is Pure Gold
**This ONE framework element (missing on most pages) could drive 20-30 position ranking improvements.**

Action: Make this Week 1-3 priority for all city pages.
