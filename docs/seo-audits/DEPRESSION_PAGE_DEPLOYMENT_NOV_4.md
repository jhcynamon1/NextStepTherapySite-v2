## 📊 **EXPECTED RESULTS**

### **Timeline:**

|--------|--------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Impressions | 0-5 | 20-40 | 50-100 | 100-150 |

## 🎯 **STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE**

### **Why Depression Page Matters:**

**1. Validates Multi-Condition Model:**
- If anxiety + depression both rank → model works
- If only anxiety ranks → need to adjust approach
- Proof of concept for scaling to other conditions

**2. Matches Inner Oak Strategy:**
- Inner Oak (Burlington #1) has 8+ condition pages
- We now have 3 (hub + 2 conditions)
- Need 5-6 more to match their coverage
- Depression proves we can replicate their winning model

**3. Easy Win (KD 7):**
- One of lowest competition keywords we're targeting
- Higher probability of ranking quickly
- Builds confidence in strategy
- Creates momentum for additional pages

**4. Prevents Cannibalization:**
- Depression queries won't compete with anxiety page
- Clear differentiation by condition
- Each page has distinct target audience
- Hub links to both (distributes authority)

**5. Foundation for Scaling:**
- Burlington = test market
- Once 3-5 condition pages work → replicate to Ottawa
- Then Mississauga, Hamilton, Toronto
- Proven playbook for 50-100 total pages
