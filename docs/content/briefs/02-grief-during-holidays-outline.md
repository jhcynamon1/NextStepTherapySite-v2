**H3: Lower Expectations for Yourself**
- You don't have to do Christmas the way you always have

- Build in recovery time

**H3: Acknowledge Their Absence**

- Others need to not make it a focal point
- There's no "right" way—only what works for your grief

**H3: Set Boundaries with Family**

### Section 5: When to Seek Support
**H2: When Grief Needs Professional Support**

Grief is not a mental illness—it's a normal response to loss. But sometimes it helps to have support, especially:
- If grief is interfering with daily functioning
- If you're isolating completely
- If thoughts of joining the person who died feel appealing
- If you're stuck and can't move forward months later
- If the holidays are triggering old trauma alongside grief

### Section 8: FAQ (6 Questions for Schema)
**H2: Frequently Asked Questions About Holiday Grief**

1. **How do I get through Christmas when I'm grieving?**
   Answer: Lower your expectations. You don't have to celebrate the way you used to—or at all. Plan for difficult moments. Allow yourself to feel sad without judgment. Accept that "getting through" is success enough this year.

2. **Is it normal to feel angry during the holidays after a loss?**
   Answer: Yes. Anger is a common part of grief, especially when you're surrounded by people enjoying something that causes you pain. Feeling angry at the holidays, at other people, even at the person who died—all of this is normal.

3. **Should I skip family Christmas if I'm grieving?**
   Answer: Only you can answer this. Some people find comfort in being with family; others find it exhausting. It's okay to set boundaries, leave early, or skip altogether if that's what you need. "I'm not ready for that this year" is a valid reason.

4. **How do I handle the first Christmas without my mom/dad?**
   Answer: The first holiday without a parent is disorienting. There's no right way to handle it. Some families create new rituals to honor them; others need to avoid reminders. Give yourself permission to do whatever helps you survive this season.

5. **Can grief therapy help during the holidays?**
   Answer: Yes. Grief therapy provides a space to process your feelings without burdening family members or hearing well-meaning but unhelpful advice. It can help you develop coping strategies specific to the holiday triggers you're facing.

6. **When does grief become depression?**
   Answer: Grief and depression share symptoms—sadness, sleep changes, difficulty concentrating. But grief tends to come in waves tied to reminders, while depression is more constant. If you're struggling to function, having thoughts of self-harm, or feel hopeless for weeks, professional support can help determine what you're experiencing.
