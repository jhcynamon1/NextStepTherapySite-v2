### Section 7: FAQ (5+ Questions for Schema)
**H2: Frequently Asked Questions**

1. **Is it normal to spend Christmas alone?**
   Answer: More common than you think. Changes in family structure, geographic distance, relationship status, and work commitments mean many adults spend December 25th alone. It's a reality, not a failure.

2. **How do I cope with spending Christmas alone?**
   Answer: Plan your day with intention rather than leaving it open. Create one thing to look forward to. Limit social media exposure. Connect with others who might also be alone. And give yourself permission to feel however you feel without judgment.

3. **Why does Christmas make loneliness feel worse?**
   Answer: Cultural expectations frame Christmas as a family event, so being alone can feel like evidence that something is wrong with you. Shorter days, holiday imagery everywhere, and social comparison amplify these feelings.

4. **Should I seek therapy if I'm lonely at Christmas?**
   Answer: If holiday loneliness is part of a larger pattern of isolation, depression, or anxiety that affects your daily life, therapy can help. If it's specifically situational to this season, therapy can still provide support and coping strategies.

5. **Can I book therapy appointments during the holidays?**
   Answer: Yes. I offer same-week appointments including during the holiday season. Virtual sessions mean you can attend from home without adding travel stress.

6. **Is virtual therapy effective for loneliness and depression?**
   Answer: Research supports that virtual therapy is as effective as in-person for concerns including depression, anxiety, and isolation. Many clients find it more accessible, especially during difficult times.
