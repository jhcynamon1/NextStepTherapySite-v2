### Section 2: Why Depression Gets Worse at Christmas
**H2: Why the Holidays Intensify Depression**

Content points:

**The gap between expectations and reality**
- Cultural narrative: Christmas should be magical
- Reality: Your depression doesn't take a holiday
- The disconnect creates shame and isolation

**Forced social interaction**
- More gatherings = more emotional labor
- Harder to hide symptoms when you're around people
- Exhausting to perform "fine" when you're not

**Seasonal factors**
- Shorter days, less sunlight
- Cold weather reduces activity
- Ontario winters are genuinely difficult
- SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) overlap

**Financial pressure**
- Gift expectations create stress
- Money worries compound existing anxiety
- Feeling like you're not "enough" when you can't afford what others can

**Family dynamics**
- Returning to family roles that feel regressive
- Unresolved conflicts resurface
- Being around people who don't understand depression

**Comparison culture**
- Social media highlights everyone's "perfect" holiday
- Feeling behind in life when reflecting on the year
- Everyone else seems to have their life together

### Section 3: Holiday Depression vs. Year-Round Depression
**H2: Is This Seasonal, or Something More?**

Content points:

**Holiday depression might be:**
- Triggered specifically by December stress
- Temporary—lifts after January
- Tied to specific circumstances (loneliness, grief, family)
- Responsive to situational changes

**Clinical depression that's worse at holidays:**
- Existed before December, intensifies now
- Persists even when holiday stressors end
- Affects multiple areas of life consistently
- May require professional treatment

**Both are valid. Both deserve support.**

### Section 4: What Actually Helps
**H2: Managing Depression During the Holidays**

**H3: Lower the Bar for Yourself**
- You don't have to attend every event
- "Good enough" is good enough
- Rest is not laziness—it's necessary

**H3: Protect Your Routine**
- Depression disrupts sleep, eating, movement
- Maintaining basics becomes harder but more important
- Small wins: one walk, one meal, one bedtime

**H3: Set Strategic Boundaries**
- Identify your highest-priority obligations
- Give yourself permission to skip the rest
- "I'm not up for that this year" is a complete sentence

**H3: Manage Light and Movement**
- Light therapy can help (even 20 minutes of bright light)
- Any movement is beneficial—lower the bar
- Get outside during daylight hours when possible

**H3: Limit Comparison Triggers**
- Social media detox or strict limits
- Curate your feed intentionally
- Remember: you're seeing highlights, not reality

**H3: Tell One Person the Truth**
- Isolation makes depression worse
- You don't have to tell everyone—but tell someone
- It can be a friend, family member, or therapist

### Section 9: FAQ (6 Questions for Schema)
**H2: Frequently Asked Questions**

1. **Why do I feel more depressed during the holidays?**
   Answer: Holiday depression has multiple causes: the gap between cultural expectations and reality, increased social pressure, seasonal factors like reduced sunlight, financial stress, and family dynamics. If you already have depression, these factors can intensify symptoms.

2. **Is holiday depression the same as Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)?**
   Answer: They can overlap but aren't identical. SAD is a clinical pattern of depression that follows seasonal cycles, typically starting in fall and lifting in spring. Holiday depression can be specifically triggered by December's stressors, regardless of seasonal patterns. Both are treatable.

3. **How do I get through Christmas when I'm depressed?**
   Answer: Lower your expectations for yourself. Protect basic routines (sleep, eating, some movement). Set boundaries with obligations. Limit social media comparison. Tell at least one person how you're really feeling. And remember: getting through is success—you don't have to enjoy it.

4. **Should I tell my family I'm depressed during the holidays?**
   Answer: Only if it would help you. Some families are supportive; others add pressure. You don't owe anyone an explanation for taking care of yourself. If telling them means they'll expect less from you, it might be worth it. If it means lectures or dismissal, protecting yourself is okay.

5. **Can therapy help with holiday depression?**
   Answer: Yes. Therapy provides a space to process what you're experiencing without judgment, develop coping strategies specific to your triggers, and address underlying factors. It can help both with surviving this season and building longer-term resilience.

6. **What if I can't afford therapy during the holidays?**
   Answer: Many Ontario employers offer mental health coverage that people don't use. Check your benefits—you may have $500-$2,000 available. If cost is a barrier, I offer same-week appointments to help you use 2025 benefits before they reset January 1st.
