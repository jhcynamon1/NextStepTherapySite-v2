Content points:

**January blues typically:**
- Last a few weeks, then lift

### Section 4: What Actually Helps
**H2: Getting Through the January Slump**

**H3: Resist the Resolution Pressure**
- January 1 is an arbitrary date
- You don't have to transform yourself right now
- Focus on surviving, not thriving
- Small sustainable actions beat dramatic changes

**H3: Manage Light and Movement**
- Light exposure matters even more now
- Morning light helps regulate mood
- Any movement counts—lower the bar dramatically
- Consider a light therapy lamp for Ontario winters

**H3: Build in Things to Look Forward To**
- January feels endless without anticipation
- Plan small things: a meal, a movie, a call with a friend
- You don't need big plans—micro-anticipation works

**H3: Address the Financial Stress**
- Make a realistic plan for holiday debt
- Avoiding the statements makes anxiety worse
- Progress over perfection

**H3: Ease Back Into Work**
- First week back: survival mode
- Lower your output expectations temporarily
- Reconnect with one colleague
- Give yourself permission to ramp up slowly

**H3: Acknowledge the Loss**

- It's okay to miss that
- January requires creating your own momentum

### Section 11: FAQ (6 Questions for Schema)
**H2: Frequently Asked Questions**

1. **What are the January blues?**
   Answer: The January blues refers to the low mood, lack of motivation, and mild depression many people experience after the holidays end. Contributing factors include post-holiday letdown, financial stress, dark and cold weather, and New Year pressure. For most people, it lifts within a few weeks.

2. **Why do I feel depressed after Christmas?**
   Answer: Post-Christmas depression is common. The holidays create artificial structure and anticipation; when they end, there's a void. Add financial stress from holiday spending, the darkest time of year, and pressure to "start fresh," and it's a perfect storm for feeling low.

3. **How long do the January blues last?**
   Answer: For most people, the January blues lift within 2-4 weeks as routine re-establishes and daylight gradually increases. If your symptoms persist into February, worsen, or significantly impact your ability to function, it may indicate clinical depression that would benefit from professional support.

4. **How do I cope with going back to work after the holidays?**
   Answer: Ease in slowly—the first week back is survival mode. Lower your output expectations. Avoid scheduling major tasks for day one. Reconnect with one supportive colleague. And acknowledge that the transition is genuinely difficult; you're not weak for finding it hard.

5. **Is therapy helpful for post-holiday depression?**
   Answer: Yes. Therapy provides a space to process the transition, develop coping strategies, and address underlying factors that make January particularly hard. It can help you build sustainable patterns rather than white-knuckling through until spring.

6. **How do I avoid the New Year's resolution trap when I'm depressed?**
   Answer: Skip resolutions entirely—or reframe January as a month for rest and recovery, not reinvention. If you do want goals, make them tiny: survival-level. The pressure to transform yourself on January 1 is marketing, not wisdom. You can start anything in March.
