## Detailed Findings

### 1. GBP POSTS - Score: 3/10

**PROOF Target:** 2 posts per week (Service proof + Local presence)

**Current State:**
- 2 posts created today (1 hour ago)
- **2-MONTH GAP** before today's posts
- 1 post from "last year"
- 2 posts REJECTED by Google

**Posts Found:**
| Date | Type | Status | Content Preview |
|------|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 hour ago | Update | Published | "Supporting clients across Ontario..." |
| 1 hour ago | Update | Published | "Virtual anxiety therapy that fits your schedule..." |
| 2 months ago | Update | Published | "Sunday evening dread..." |
| 2 months ago | Update | Published | "Anxiety Therapy for Ontario Professionals" |
| 2 months ago | Update | REJECTED | "3 Signs You Might Benefit from Therapy" |
| 2 months ago | Update | REJECTED | "Feeling overwhelmed at work?" |
| 2 months ago | Offer | Published | "Free 15-Minute Consultation" |
| Last year | Update | Published | "Don't let anxiety hold you back..." |

**Issues:**
- Major posting gaps (not 2/week)
- 2 posts rejected (review rejection reasons)
- No consistent cadence

**Recommendations:**
1. Post 2x per week minimum (Mon + Fri)
2. Alternate: Service proof → Local presence
3. Review why posts were rejected (likely too salesy or promotional language)
4. Schedule posts in advance using Google Business tools
5. Include photos with every post

---

### 2. REVIEWS - Score: 4/10

**PROOF Target:** Steady review velocity with keyword-rich content

**Current State:**
- **3 reviews total** (very low)
- All 5-star rating (good!)
- All from 6-8 weeks ago (no recency)
- **NO owner replies**

**Reviews Found:**
| Reviewer | Rating | Date | Content | Keywords |
|----------|--------|------|---------|----------|
| Josh Cynamon | 5★ | 6 weeks ago | (no text) | None |
| Jared Kaufman | 5★ | 7 weeks ago | "A really helpful therapist!" | None |
| HF | 5★ | 8 weeks ago | "I always call Next Step for my mental health questions." | "mental health" |

**Issues:**
- Only 3 reviews (competitors may have 10-50+)
- One reviewer shares owner's last name (potential flag)
- No keyword-rich content (missing: Ontario, anxiety, virtual therapy, Burlington)
- Zero owner replies
- CRPO Standard 6.2.2 limits review solicitation

**Recommendations:**
1. **Reply to ALL reviews immediately** - thank reviewers, reinforce keywords naturally
2. Since you cannot solicit reviews (CRPO 6.2.2), focus on:
   - Excellent service that naturally generates reviews
   - Making review process easy (share link when appropriate)
   - Encouraging satisfied clients who volunteer to mention services/location
3. Add review link to email signature and website footer

---

### 3. PHOTOS - Score: 3/10 🔴 CRITICAL GAP

**PROOF Target:** 8 photos/month (2 per week)

**Current State:**
- **3 photos total** (competitors may have 15-30+)
  1. Cover photo (logo)
  2. Logo (compass branding)
  3. Professional headshot

**Why This Matters:**
- Google favors profiles with rich media
- Profiles with 15+ photos get more clicks
- Photos signal "active, legitimate business"

---

## PHOTO STRATEGY (Added Dec 22, 2025)
