## Detailed Findings

### 1. GBP POSTS - Score: 3/10

**PROOF Target:** 2 posts per week (Service proof + Local presence)

**Current State:**
- 2 posts created today (1 hour ago)
- **2-MONTH GAP** before today's posts
- 1 post from "last year"
- 2 posts REJECTED by Google

**Posts Found:**
| Date | Type | Status | Content Preview |
|------|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 hour ago | Update | Published | "Supporting clients across Ontario..." |
| 1 hour ago | Update | Published | "Virtual anxiety therapy that fits your schedule..." |
| 2 months ago | Update | Published | "Sunday evening dread..." |
| 2 months ago | Update | Published | "Anxiety Therapy for Ontario Professionals" |
| 2 months ago | Update | REJECTED | "3 Signs You Might Benefit from Therapy" |
| 2 months ago | Update | REJECTED | "Feeling overwhelmed at work?" |
| 2 months ago | Offer | Published | "Free 15-Minute Consultation" |
| Last year | Update | Published | "Don't let anxiety hold you back..." |

**Issues:**
- Major posting gaps (not 2/week)
- 2 posts rejected (review rejection reasons)
- No consistent cadence

**Recommendations:**
1. Post 2x per week minimum (Mon + Fri)
2. Alternate: Service proof → Local presence
3. Review why posts were rejected (likely too salesy or promotional language)
4. Schedule posts in advance using Google Business tools
5. Include photos with every post

---

### 2. REVIEWS - Score: 4/10

**PROOF Target:** Steady review velocity with keyword-rich content

**Current State:**
- **3 reviews total** (very low)
- All 5-star rating (good!)
- All from 6-8 weeks ago (no recency)
- **NO owner replies**

**Reviews Found:**
| Reviewer | Rating | Date | Content | Keywords |
|----------|--------|------|---------|----------|
| Josh Cynamon | 5★ | 6 weeks ago | (no text) | None |
| Jared Kaufman | 5★ | 7 weeks ago | "A really helpful therapist!" | None |
| HF | 5★ | 8 weeks ago | "I always call Next Step for my mental health questions." | "mental health" |

**Issues:**
- Only 3 reviews (competitors may have 10-50+)
- One reviewer shares owner's last name (potential flag)
- No keyword-rich content (missing: Ontario, anxiety, virtual therapy, Burlington)
- Zero owner replies
- CRPO Standard 6.2.2 limits review solicitation

**Recommendations:**
1. **Reply to ALL reviews immediately** - thank reviewers, reinforce keywords naturally
2. Since you cannot solicit reviews (CRPO 6.2.2), focus on:
   - Excellent service that naturally generates reviews
   - Making review process easy (share link when appropriate)
   - Encouraging satisfied clients who volunteer to mention services/location
3. Add review link to email signature and website footer

---

### 3. PHOTOS - Score: 3/10 🔴 CRITICAL GAP

**PROOF Target:** 8 photos/month (2 per week)

**Current State:**
- **3 photos total** (competitors may have 15-30+)
  1. Cover photo (logo)
  2. Logo (compass branding)
  3. Professional headshot

**Why This Matters:**
- Google favors profiles with rich media
- Profiles with 15+ photos get more clicks
- Photos signal "active, legitimate business"

---

## PHOTO STRATEGY (Added Dec 22, 2025)

### Goal: Add 12-15 photos over next 4 weeks

**Upload Schedule:** 2-3 photos per week (DO NOT bulk upload)

---

### PART A: Home Office Photos to Take (Real Photos)

**Equipment needed:** iPhone/smartphone, natural lighting, clean background

#### Shot List - Virtual Therapy Setup

| # | Shot | Composition | Caption (with keywords) |
|---|------|-------------|-------------------------|
| 1 | **Laptop workspace wide** | Desk, laptop, plant, lamp - clean professional look | "Virtual therapy sessions from my Ontario home office. Same-week appointments available." |
| 2 | **Laptop screen angle** | Over-shoulder view showing video call setup (blank screen) | "Secure virtual therapy platform - PIPEDA compliant for Ontario clients" |
| 3 | **Desk detail** | Notepad, pen, coffee mug, calm aesthetic | "Preparing for an anxiety therapy session with an Ontario professional" |
| 4 | **Bookshelf/credentials** | Books on therapy, framed certificate if visible | "Evidence-based approaches: ACT and CBT resources for depression and anxiety treatment" |
| 5 | **Chair/seating area** | Comfortable therapy chair or seating setup | "Creating a calm space for virtual burnout recovery sessions" |
| 6 | **Window light shot** | Natural lighting, plants, calm environment | "Where virtual therapy happens - supporting professionals across Ontario" |
| 7 | **Ring light/tech setup** | Professional video equipment | "Professional virtual therapy setup ensuring quality sessions from Toronto to Ottawa" |
| 8 | **Headphones/audio** | Quality audio setup | "Clear communication matters - professional audio for virtual counselling" |

**Tips for taking these:**
- Shoot during golden hour (morning or late afternoon) for warm lighting
- Remove clutter - minimalist is better
- Include plants/greenery if possible
- No client info visible (CRPO compliance)
- Landscape orientation (1200x900px minimum)

---

### PART B: Why Real Photos Only (Updated Dec 27, 2025)

**AI-generated photos are NOT recommended for GBP.** Research shows:

| Risk | Source |
|------|--------|
| Algorithm distrust | Google now scans visual content for authenticity signals |
| Suspension risk | Reported cases of listings suspended after AI images |
| User trust erosion | Users can often tell, feels inauthentic |
| Guidelines violation | Google wants images that "represent reality" |

**Sources:** [Local Search Forum](https://localsearchforum.com/threads/do-you-use-ai-generated-images-for-your-gmb.61421/), [PinMeTo GBP Guidelines 2025](https://www.pinmeto.com/blog/google-business-profile-guidelines-2025), [BrightLocal](https://www.brightlocal.com/learn/ai-google-business-profile-homepage/)

---

### PART C: Photo Upload Schedule (Real Photos Only)

**Week 1 (Dec 23-29):**
- Mon: Laptop workspace wide
- Fri: Desk detail shot OR headshot variation

**Week 2 (Dec 30 - Jan 5):**
- Mon: Bookshelf with therapy books
- Fri: CRPO certificate/credentials

**Week 3 (Jan 6-12):**
- Mon: Chair/seating area
- Wed: Window light shot
- Fri: Different angle of workspace

**Week 4 (Jan 13-19):**
- Mon: Video call setup (ring light, camera)
- Fri: Coffee mug + notepad detail shot

---

### PART D: Photo Naming & Captions (SEO)

**File naming convention:**
```
nextstep-therapy-[keyword]-ontario-[number].jpg

Examples:
- nextstep-therapy-virtual-session-ontario-1.jpg
- nextstep-therapy-anxiety-treatment-workspace-2.jpg
- nextstep-therapy-burnout-recovery-office-3.jpg
```

**Caption formula:**
`[What's shown] + [Service keyword] + [Location] + [Differentiator]`

Examples:
- "Virtual therapy workspace for anxiety treatment sessions across Ontario. Same-week appointments available."
- "Professional home office setup for depression counselling. Serving Burlington, Toronto, and all of Ontario."
- "Where burnout recovery begins - virtual sessions for Ontario professionals. CRPO #10979"

---

## PART E: Office Photo Setup Guide (Added Dec 27, 2025)

**Purpose:** Set up your home office for professional GBP photos that build trust.

### The Goal
Photos that say: "This is a real professional who takes their work seriously and creates a calm, trustworthy environment."

### What Google & Users Want
| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Real, authentic photos | Stock photos or AI-generated |
| Well-lit, clear shots | Dark, blurry, or shadowy |
| Clean, professional background | Cluttered or distracting |
| Consistent, intentional staging | Random snapshots |

---

### Step 1: Lighting (Most Important)

| Scenario | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| **Best:** Natural window light | Face the window, camera between you and window |
| **Good:** Ring light | Position at eye level, in front of you |
| **Avoid:** Overhead lighting only | Creates harsh shadows |
| **Avoid:** Window behind you | Silhouettes your face |

**Bulb temperature:** Use warm white (3000K or lower) - labeled "soft white." Avoid "daylight" or "cool white" (4000K+).

---

### Step 2: Background & Staging

**Key principle:** Something in background (not blank wall), but not entire room visible.

**Elements that work well for therapy office:**

| Element | Why It Works | Where to Get |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| **Plants** | Calming, alive, professional | IKEA, local nursery (pothos, snake plant, peace lily) |
| **Books** | Credibility signal | Your existing therapy books |
| **Soft lamp** | Warm lighting, cozy feel | IKEA, Amazon |
| **Neutral art** | Visual interest without distraction | Abstract, nature prints |
| **CRPO certificate** | Trust signal | Frame and hang |
| **Comfortable chair** | Shows intentionality | Your existing chair |

**What to AVOID in frame:**
- Personal photos (privacy)
- Religious symbols (unless intentional part of practice)
- Clutter, stacks of paper
- Bright/distracting colors
- TVs, gaming equipment
- Dirty dishes, laundry

---

### Step 3: Camera Position & Framing

| For Video Calls | For GBP Photos |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Camera at eye level | Camera at desk/tripod level |
| Face fills ~60% of frame | Show more of the space |
| Direct eye contact with lens | Can be empty chair/desk shot |

**GBP-specific framing tips:**
- **Landscape orientation** (4:3 ratio) - Google crops portrait photos awkwardly
- **Leave space at top** - Google crops from bottom up
- **Multiple angles** - Wide shot, medium shot, detail shot
- **Show depth** - Don't shoot flat against wall

---

### Step 4: Recommended Props/Setup

**Minimum viable setup:**
- [ ] Clean desk surface
- [ ] Laptop or monitor
- [ ] One plant
- [ ] One lamp (warm light)
- [ ] Notepad + pen
- [ ] Coffee mug (branded or neutral)

**Level-up additions:**
- [ ] Bookshelf with therapy books
- [ ] Framed CRPO certificate
- [ ] Comfortable chair visible
- [ ] Soft throw blanket on chair
- [ ] Small art piece or print

**Color palette to aim for:**
- Neutrals: cream, beige, soft gray, white
- Accents: sage green, navy, warm wood tones
- Avoid: bright red, neon, busy patterns

---

### Step 5: AI Touch-Up (Acceptable)

**AI enhancement of REAL photos is OK.** AI-generated fake photos are NOT.

**Acceptable touch-ups:**
- Brightness/contrast adjustment
- Color correction (warmer tones)
- Removing small blemishes or dust
- Sharpening slightly blurry photos
- Cropping for better composition

**Tools:**
- Google Photos (free) - Magic Eraser, lighting adjustment
- Snapseed (free app) - Professional editing
- Lightroom Mobile (free tier) - Color correction

**NOT acceptable:**
- Adding fake elements (furniture, plants that aren't there)
- Generating entire fake backgrounds
- Making space look significantly different from reality

### Step 6: Photo Shot List (When Ready)

Take all these in ONE session:

| # | Shot | Framing | Caption Focus |
|---|------|---------|---------------|
| 1 | Wide workspace | Desk + chair + background | "Virtual therapy workspace" |
| 2 | Laptop/screen | Medium shot, angled | "Secure video sessions" |
| 3 | Desk detail | Notepad, pen, mug closeup | "Preparing for session" |
| 4 | Bookshelf | Books visible | "Evidence-based approaches" |
| 5 | CRPO certificate | Clear, readable | "CRPO #10979 registered" |
| 6 | Chair/seating | Comfortable setup | "Professional therapy environment" |
| 7 | Window light | Natural lighting visible | "Calm, welcoming space" |
| 8 | Tech setup | Ring light, camera | "Quality virtual sessions" |

**Batch these:** Take all 8 in 20 minutes, then you have 4 weeks of photos ready.
