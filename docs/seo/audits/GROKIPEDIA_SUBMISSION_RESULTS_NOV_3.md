## ⏭️ PAGES SKIPPED (Already Accurate)

## 💰 ROI ANALYSIS

### Time Investment:
- Initial research: 2-3 hours (user did manually)
- Atlas browser submission: ~1 hour
- **Total: 3-4 hours**

### Expected Return (if 4/5 accepted):

## 🎯 LEARNINGS

### What Worked:
1. ✅ **Flexible text matching** - Pages had similar (not exact) text
2. ✅ **Manual verification** - Ensured we corrected actual errors
3. ✅ **Canadian data angle** - Legitimate improvement, not spam
4. ✅ **Authoritative sources** - Statistics Canada, MHCC, etc.
5. ✅ **Topic alignment** - All our core specialties

### What Didn't Work:
1. ❌ Some pages already accurate (good problem to have)
2. ❌ Exact text matching failed (V1 prompt too rigid)
3. ❌ Some expected errors weren't there (Grokipedia is well-maintained)

### Optimizations for Next Time:
1. ✅ Use flexible matching from the start
2. ✅ Expect 40-60% of pages to already be accurate
3. ✅ Focus on topics where US data commonly appears
4. ✅ Check Grokipedia quarterly for new errors (they update regularly)

## 🔄 FUTURE STRATEGY

### Quarterly Grokipedia Check:
- **When:** Every 3 months (Feb, May, Aug, Nov)
- **Pages:** Same 10 + new mental health topics
- **Effort:** ~1 hour via Atlas browser
- **Expected:** 2-5 new corrections per quarter

### Scaling Opportunities:
- [ ] Expand to 20+ mental health topics
- [ ] Add relationship/couples topics (if we offer that)
- [ ] Monitor Grokipedia "Recent Changes" for new pages
- [ ] Set Google Alert: `site:grokipedia.com mental health statistics`

### Alternative Strategies (if Grokipedia DR <30):
- Priority 1: HARO responses (higher DR)
- Priority 2: Psychology Today listing
- Priority 3: Local directories
- Priority 4: Guest posts on therapy blogs
