## Executive Summary

| Status | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| **Verification** | ✅ 100% VERIFIED |
| **Profile Strength** | 🟠 INCOMPLETE (Orange indicator) |
| **Business Type** | SAB (Service Area Business) - 10-20x harder than physical locations |
| **Overall Grade** | C+ (Significant optimization opportunities) |

Your GBP is verified and functional but significantly underoptimized. As a **Service Area Business (SAB)**, you face unique challenges - no physical address means you're competing at a 10-20x disadvantage against businesses with storefronts. This audit combines:

1. **Chrome extension live audit** (Dec 20-21, 2025)
2. **Your existing GBP guides** (Oct-Nov 2025)
3. **PROOF Local SEO System** (Dec 2025)
4. **SAB-specific strategies** for virtual therapy

---

## CRITICAL: SAB (Service Area Business) Reality

### Why This Matters

You work from home and only meet clients virtually. Google treats this as a **Service Area Business (SAB)**, which means:

| Factor | Physical Address | SAB (You) |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| Map Pack eligibility | Full eligibility | Limited/harder |
| "Near me" searches | Strong signal | Weak signal |
| Local pack ranking | Address = trust | Must compensate with other signals |
| Trust signals | Storefront photos, directions | Reviews, content, authority |

### SAB Compensation Strategy

Since you can't compete on address proximity, you must DOMINATE these areas:

1. **Reviews** - 3x more important for SABs
2. **Service Area specificity** - List specific cities, not "Ontario"
3. **GBP completeness** - Every section must be filled
4. **Content depth** - Your website pages support GBP rankings
5. **Post consistency** - Signals active business without address
6. **Q&A section** - Keywords + trust signals

- 2 posts were **REJECTED by Google** - likely content policy violation
- All posts are 2+ months old
- Zero posting cadence established

**Action Required:**
- Review rejected posts to understand why
- Resume posting immediately (2/week per PROOF system)

### Q&A Section - BETTER THAN EXPECTED

| Metric | Finding | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Total Q&As | ~8 | 15-20 | 🟡 PARTIAL |

**Q&As Found:**
1. Men's mental health support
2. Therapy approach (ACT/CBT mentioned)
3. Virtual therapy effectiveness
4. Appointment availability (48 hours, no waitlist)
5. Insurance coverage
6. Ontario service areas (cities listed)
7. Career transitions
8. Workplace stress and burnout

**Verdict:** Better than expected (was estimated at 0-5), but still 7-12 short of target.

### Services Section

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Services Listed | ⚠️ Needs verification in GBP |
| Primary Category | Psychotherapist ✅ |

### Products Section

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Products Listed | ❌ Likely none |
| Recommended | "Anxiety & Stress Therapy" @ $175 |

---

## Section 1: Verification Status

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Business Verified | ✅ Yes | Confirmed in GBP Manager |
| Owner Access | ✅ Yes | "You manage this Business Profile" |
| Store Code | 1730079957977015062 | Unique identifier |

**Verdict:** PASS - No action needed

---

## Section 2: Basic Information

| Field | Current Value | Status | Action |
|-------|---------------|--------|--------|
| Business Name | Next Step Therapy | ✅ Correct | None |
| Primary Category | Psychotherapist | ✅ Correct | None |
| Phone | (416) 306-2157 | ✅ Present | Verify NAP consistency |
| Website | nextsteptherapy.ca | ✅ Linked | None |
| Booking Link | janeapp.com | ✅ Linked | None |
| Hours | Opens 9 a.m. Mon | ⚠️ Review | Add evening/weekend visibility |

**Verdict:** PASS - Basic info is correct

---

## Section 3: Service Areas (CRITICAL for SAB)

| Current | Recommended |
|---------|-------------|
| Ontario, Canada, Barrie, ON + 13 other areas | Specific cities only |

### Current Service Areas (14 total detected)
Need to verify full list includes priority cities.

### Recommended Service Areas (SAB Best Practice)
**Priority Cities (add if missing):**
- Toronto
- Mississauga
- Burlington
- Oakville
- Hamilton
- Ottawa

**REMOVE:** Broad "Ontario" designation (too generic for map pack - hurts SABs especially)

**SAB-Specific Note:** Specific cities are even MORE important for SABs. Google can't verify you're "in" Ontario since you have no address. City-level specificity builds relevance.

**Verdict:** ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW - Remove "Ontario", keep specific cities

---

## Section 4: Reviews (CRITICAL GAP - 3x Important for SAB)

| Metric | Current | Target | Gap |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| Total Reviews | 3 | 50+ | -47 |
| Average Rating | 5.0 ⭐ | 4.8+ | ✅ Exceeds |
| Monthly Velocity | ~0 | 3-4/month | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| Response Rate | Unknown | 100% | Verify |

### Why Reviews Are 3x More Important for SABs

Without a physical address:
- Reviews are your PRIMARY trust signal
- Review keywords signal service relevance
- Review velocity signals active business
- Responses show you're engaged

### PROOF System Review Strategy

**Goal:** 6 review requests per completed client engagement

**Exact Process:**
1. Ask the same day (text > email)
2. Send direct review link
3. Ask ONE thing only

**Exact Ask (Copy-Paste):**
> "If you don't mind, could you mention what service we did and your city? It really helps us."

**Why This Works:**
- Google parses reviews for service + location language
- "anxiety therapy" + "Burlington" = relevance signal
- Natural, not fake or incentivized

### Action Items
1. [ ] Request reviews from 10-12 recent satisfied clients
2. [ ] Use the PROOF script: "mention what service and your city"
3. [ ] Goal: 3-4 reviews per month minimum
4. [ ] Respond to all existing reviews within 24 hours

**Verdict:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Major gap affecting local ranking

---

## Section 5: Photos (CRITICAL GAP)

| Type | Current | Recommended | Status |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| Profile Photo | Unknown | 1 professional headshot | ⚠️ Verify |
| Cover Photo | Present (logo) | Branded/calming image | ⚠️ Review |
| Storefront Photo | ❌ N/A (SAB) | Virtual workspace instead | 🟡 Adapt |
| Business Photos | ❌ Missing | 10-15 minimum | 🔴 Add |
| Total Photos | ~1-2 | 20+ | 🔴 Major gap |

### SAB-Specific Photo Strategy

Since you can't show a storefront, show:
1. **Professional headshot** of Jesse (warm, approachable)
2. **Virtual session setup** (screen, professional background)
3. **Home office/workspace** (if professional-looking)
4. **Credentials display** (CRPO certificate)
5. **Infographics** (anxiety tips, stress management visuals)
6. **Technology setup** (showing professional virtual capability)
7. **Educational content** screenshots

### PROOF System Photo Cadence
- Upload 2 photos/week
- Add short captions using service words
- Do NOT dump 20 photos at once

**2025 Note:** AI detects stock photos. Use genuine images only.

**Verdict:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Photos increase engagement 35%

---

## Section 6: Profile Completeness

Google shows **Orange profile strength indicator** = incomplete sections.

### Sections Status

| Section | Status | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Business Description | ⚠️ Verify | HIGH |
| Services | ⚠️ Verify | HIGH |

| Q&A | 🟡 ~8 found (need 15-20) | HIGH |

## Section 7: Google Posts (PROOF System Integration)

| Metric | Current | PROOF Target |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| Post Frequency | ~0 (2 months stale) | 2/week |
| Last Post | ~2 months ago | Within 7 days |
| Posts Published | 3 | N/A |
| **Posts REJECTED** | 2 | 0 |

### PROOF System Post Strategy

**P = GBP Posts (2 per week)**

Each week, post only 2 things:

#### Post 1: Service Proof
- Real insight about therapy approach (maintain confidentiality)
- One sentence explaining what was addressed
- Mention the service once (no keyword stuffing)
- Example: "Helped a professional work through presentation anxiety this week using ACT techniques."

#### Post 2: Local Presence
- Office setup, professional headshot updates
- Ontario-focused content
- Confirms you're active in the area
- Example: "Available for evening virtual sessions across Ontario this week."

### Why Posts Matter for SABs
- Signals active business (critical without physical presence)
- Increases profile engagement
- Stabilizes map rankings once you start climbing

### Recommended Post Calendar

| Week | Post 1 (Service) | Post 2 (Presence) |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Workplace burnout insight | Evening availability reminder |
| 2 | Anxiety management tip | Ontario coverage update |
| 3 | ACT technique highlight | Virtual setup showcase |
| 4 | Seasonal stress topic | Professional background photo |

### REJECTED Posts - Action Required
2 posts were rejected by Google. Need to:
1. [ ] Review rejected content for policy violations
2. [ ] Avoid: promotional language, claims without evidence, pricing details
3. [ ] Resubmit compliant versions

**Verdict:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Resume posting immediately

**Verdict:** 🟠 INCOMPLETE

---

## Section 12: 2025 AI & Voice Search Considerations

## Competitive Gap Analysis

### You vs. Typical Ontario Therapy Competitors

| Factor | NextStep | Competitors | Advantage |
|--------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| CRPO # displayed | ✅ #10979 | ~10% | YOU |
| 2000+ word pages | ✅ Yes | ~0% | YOU |
| FAQ schema | ✅ Some pages | ~20% | YOU |
| GBP reviews | 3 | 20-100+ | THEM |
| GBP photos | ~2 | 5-20 | THEM |
| Weekly posts | ❌ Stale | ~10% | THEM |
| Q&A section | 🟡 8 | ~5% have any | YOU |
| Physical address | ❌ SAB | ~80% have one | THEM |

### SAB Compensation Score

To overcome the 10-20x SAB disadvantage, you need to score higher in compensating factors:

| Factor | Current | Target | Gap |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| Reviews | 3 | 25+ | -22 |
| Photos | ~2 | 20+ | -18 |
| Posts (recent) | 0 | 8/month | -8 |
| Q&As | 8 | 20 | -12 |
| Profile Complete | 🟠 | 🟢 | Incomplete |

**Key Insight:** Your website SEO is stronger than most competitors, but your GBP is weaker. As an SAB, you need GBP to be 2x stronger than physical-address competitors to rank equally.
