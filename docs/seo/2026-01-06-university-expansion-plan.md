# University Page Expansion Plan

## Why This Works

**Proof of concept:** UofT student therapy page is ranking:
- **#1** for "uoft counselling" (Vol 50)
- **#2** for "uoft therapy" (Vol 150)

This is your highest-ranking content. The pattern is proven. Replicate it.

3. 2-3 other university pages (cross-promote)
4. Relevant city page (e.g., Waterloo → anxiety-therapy-kitchener-waterloo.html)

AND be linked FROM:
1. student-mental-health-ontario.html
2. homepage (university section if exists)
3. Related blog posts (exam anxiety, homesick, etc.)

## Expected Results

Based on UofT performance:

| Metric | Per Page (Est.) | Total (9 new pages) |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Monthly impressions | 500-1000 | 4,500-9,000 |
| Monthly clicks | 10-30 | 90-270 |
| Ranking keywords | 3-5 | 27-45 |

**Timeline to ranking:** 8-12 weeks per page (faster for low-competition university terms)

---

## Content Differentiation

**DO NOT** copy-paste the UofT page and swap university names. Google will see this as duplicate/thin content.

Each page needs:
- Unique intro paragraph
- Unique program-specific stress section
- Unique insurance details
- Unique FAQ questions
- Unique testimonial-style scenarios (not testimonials - CRPO compliant)

**Minimum unique content:** 70% unique per page

---

## Keyword Research Needed

Before creating each page, verify:
1. Search volume for "[university] counselling"
2. Search volume for "[university abbreviation] therapy"
3. Top 5 competitors for that keyword
4. What's the content gap?

Use Ahrefs Keywords Explorer or check GSC for any existing impressions.
