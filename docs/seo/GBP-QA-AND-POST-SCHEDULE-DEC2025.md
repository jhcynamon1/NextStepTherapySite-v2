### Recommended Q&As to Add (6 new ones)

**How to add:** Use an incognito window or different Google account to ask questions, then answer from your owner account.

#### Q1: How much does therapy cost?
**Answer:** Sessions are $175 for a 50-minute individual session. I provide detailed receipts for insurance reimbursement that work with all major Ontario insurance providers. Many clients get 80-100% covered through their benefits. I also offer a free 15-minute consultation so we can determine if we're a good fit before you commit.

#### Q2: Do you offer evening or weekend appointments?
**Answer:** Yes! I understand professionals have demanding schedules. I offer evening appointments up to 8pm on weekdays and Saturday morning slots. Since all sessions are virtual, you can connect from home after work without commute time. Book online anytime at nextsteptherapy.janeapp.com.

#### Q3: What issues do you specialize in?
**Answer:** I specialize in anxiety, depression, workplace stress, burnout, and career transitions. I work primarily with high-functioning professionals and young adults who are managing demanding careers while dealing with imposter syndrome, perfectionism, or life transitions. My approach combines ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) and CBT tailored to your needs.

#### Q4: How do I know if therapy is working?
**Answer:** Great question. Progress looks different for everyone, but common signs include: feeling less overwhelmed by situations that used to trigger anxiety, developing new coping strategies that actually work, improved sleep or concentration, and feeling more confident in your decisions. We'll track progress together and adjust our approach as needed.

#### Q5: Can I do therapy from work during lunch?
**Answer:** Absolutely. Many of my clients connect from their office, car, or a quiet spot during lunch breaks. All you need is a private space with decent internet and your phone or laptop. Virtual therapy makes it possible to get support without disrupting your workday. Sessions are 50 minutes, leaving you time to reset before afternoon meetings.

#### Q6: Do you help with imposter syndrome?
**Answer:** Yes, imposter syndrome is one of the most common concerns I work with, especially among high-achieving professionals. We'll explore where these feelings come from and develop practical strategies to recognize your actual accomplishments. Using ACT techniques, you'll learn to acknowledge self-doubt without letting it hold you back from opportunities.
