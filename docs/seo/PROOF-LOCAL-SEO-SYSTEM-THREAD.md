## Overview

"My PROOF system works so well at Local SEO it feels ILLEGAL"

Results shown: 152K total clicks, 22.5M total impressions, 0.7% average CTR, position 7 average

---

## First: What PROOF Actually Fixes

Most local SEO fails because businesses:
- Post randomly
- Ask for reviews inconsistently
- Have useless service pages
- Upload photos in bursts
- Rely on ads instead of trust

**PROOF forces weekly execution across the 5 signals Google weighs most.**

---

## P = GBP Posts (2 per week)

Most businesses post offers or random updates that no one searches for.

**What actually works:**

Each week, post only 2 things:

### a) Post 1 - Service proof
- Real job photo (phone is fine)
- One sentence explaining what was done
- Mention the service once (no stuffing)

### b) Post 2 - Local presence
- Team, truck, storefront, or tools
- Short caption that confirms you're active in the area

These posts increase profile engagement and freshness.

That stabilizes map rankings once you start climbing.

---

## R = Review Requests (6 per week)

**Goal:** review velocity + keyword relevance

**Exact process:**
- Ask the same day (text > email)
- Send direct review link
- Ask ONE thing only

**Exact ask to copy-paste:**
> "If you don't mind, could you mention what service we did and your city? It really helps us."

**Why this works:**
Google parses reviews for service + location language.
This feeds relevance without fake reviews.

---

## O = Optimized Money Pages (4 per month)

**Goal:** give Google pages that deserve to rank

**One page = one service + one city**

**Do NOT mix services.**

### Page checklist:
- H1: Service in City
- URL: /service-city/
- 600-900 words (no fluff)

### Sections:
- What the service includes
- Pricing factors
- Local examples
- FAQ (real questions)

### Internal links:
- Homepage → money page
- Core service page → money page

This is what supports your GBP rankings.

---

## O = On-site Real Photos (8 per month)

**Goal:** increase trust + CTR

### What to upload:
- Job in progress
- Finished work
- Team on site
- Vehicle/tools

### How:
- Upload 2 photos/week
- Add short captions using service words
- Do NOT dump 20 photos at once

### Why this matters:
Higher CTR → stronger map pack retention.

---

## F = Free Traffic (Zero ads at first)

**Goal:** force fundamentals

If you run ads too early:
- You ignore reviews. You ignore pages.
- GBP stays weak.

**Organic first = defensible rankings**

**Ads later = scale**

---

## 30/60/90-Day Expectations (REALISTIC)

- **30 days:** impressions increase
- **60 days:** map visibility spreads
- **90 days:** calls become consistent

---
