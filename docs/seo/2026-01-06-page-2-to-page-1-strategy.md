## Keyword-by-Keyword Strategy

### 1. "how much does therapy cost" (Position 17 → Target: Top 5)
**Status:** CLOSEST TO PAGE 1 - Highest priority

**Current page:** therapy-costs-ontario.html

**Why it's stuck:**
- Position 17 = top of page 2
- Low authority (DR 2.3)
- Competing against high-authority sites

**Action plan:**
1. [ ] **Build 2-3 backlinks** to this specific page (guest posts, HARO)
2. [ ] **Add more internal links** - link from EVERY service page footer
3. [ ] **Expand content** - add Ontario-specific cost breakdown by city
4. [ ] **Add comparison table** - NextStep vs average Ontario rates
5. [ ] **Update title** to include "2026" for freshness

**Expected timeline:** 4-6 weeks to page 1

---

### 2. Quiz Keywords (Position 44-89 → Target: Top 20)
**Keywords:** "do i need therapy" (89), "should i see a therapist quiz" (54), "what type of therapy do i need quiz" (44)

**Current page:** blog/mental-health-guides/do-i-need-therapy-quiz.html

**Why they're stuck:**
- Blog subfolder has less authority than root
- Quiz results may not be indexable
- Thin surrounding content
- Page is ranking for 3 keywords - may need to split

**Action plan:**
1. [ ] **Move quiz to root** - /do-i-need-therapy-quiz.html (more authority)
2. [ ] **Expand content to 3000+ words** around the quiz
3. [ ] **Add more FAQ schema** specific to quiz questions
4. [ ] **Create separate page** for "what type of therapy" (reduce cannibalization)
5. [ ] **Add 10+ internal links** pointing to quiz page
6. [ ] **Build 1-2 backlinks** specifically to quiz

**Expected timeline:** 6-8 weeks to page 1-2

---

### 3. "anxiety therapist near me" (Position 77 → Target: Top 20)
**Current page:** anxiety-therapy-ontario.html

**Why it's stuck:**
- "Near me" queries favor local businesses with Google Business Profile
- Competing against directories (Psychology Today, etc.)
- Need local signals

**Action plan:**
1. [ ] **Optimize for Local SEO** - add LocalBusiness schema
2. [ ] **Add city-specific sections** with links to each city page
3. [ ] **Include "near me" variations** in content naturally
4. [ ] **Build citations** on therapy directories
5. [ ] **Add Google Business Profile** content sync

**Expected timeline:** 8-12 weeks (local SEO is slower)

---

### 4. "how to find a therapist" (Position 97 → Target: Top 30)
**Current page:** how-to-find-therapist-ontario.html

**Why it's stuck:**
- Position 97 = barely ranking
- Likely thin content or not matching search intent
- Competing against major health sites

**Action plan:**
1. [ ] **Analyze top 5 competitors** - what do they have that we don't?
2. [ ] **Expand to 2500+ words** with step-by-step guide
3. [ ] **Add HowTo schema** markup
4. [ ] **Create checklist/downloadable** resource
5. [ ] **Add internal links** from all service pages

**Expected timeline:** 8-12 weeks

---

### 5. "how to recover from burnout" (Position 81 → Target: Top 30)
**Current page:** blog/workplace/how-to-recover-from-burnout

**Why it's stuck:**
- KD 35 = moderately competitive
- Blog subfolder authority issue
- Competing against major publications (Forbes, HBR)

**Action plan:**
1. [ ] **Move to root or create service page** for burnout
2. [ ] **Expand content significantly** - aim for 3000+ words
3. [ ] **Add expert quotes/citations** from burnout research
4. [ ] **Create burnout-recovery-therapy.html** service page
5. [ ] **Internal link from all workplace pages**

**Expected timeline:** 10-14 weeks (competitive keyword)
