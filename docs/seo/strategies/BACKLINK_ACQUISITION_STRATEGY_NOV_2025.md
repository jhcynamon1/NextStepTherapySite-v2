## 🎨 MEDIUM-TERM PLAYS (Month 2-4)

### **Linkable Assets Strategy**

**1. Create "Do I Need Therapy?" Quiz** ⭐ HIGH VALUE
- **What:** Interactive assessment (already have page, make it embeddable)
- **Why:** Bloggers, student sites, HR pages link to helpful tools
- **Examples:** [Mental health quizzes attract organic backlinks](https://crownsvillemedia.com/how-to-get-backlinks-for-your-therapy-website)
- **Implementation:**
  - Make quiz embeddable (widget code)

  - Promote on social, let it spread organically
- **Expected:** 5-10 backlinks within 3-6 months
- **Time:** 4-6 hours to build embed feature

**2. "State of Mental Health in Ontario" Data Report**
- **What:** Annual report with original survey data
- **Why:** Journalists NEED local mental health statistics to cite
- **Gap:** [Most data is national, not provincial/local](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/)
- **Implementation:**
  - Survey your email list (100-200 responses)
  - Create data visualization (charts, graphs)
  - Publish as PDF + web page
  - Title: "Mental Health in Ontario 2025: Survey of 200 Professionals"
- **Expected:** 10-20 backlinks from media, blogs, resource pages
- **Time:** 10-15 hours (survey + analysis + design)

**3. ADHD Self-Assessment Tool**
- **What:** Free, validated ADHD screener
- **Why:** ADHD resources are highly sought, few tools exist
- **Target:** Gets linked from r/ADHD, student resources, HR pages
- **Implementation:**
  - Create simple screening questionnaire
  - Add scoring interpretation
  - Make embeddable
  - Note: "Not diagnostic, educational only" (CRPO compliant)
- **Expected:** 8-15 backlinks over 6 months
- **Time:** 6-8 hours

**4. Workplace Burnout Calculator**
- **What:** Interactive tool assessing burnout levels
- **Why:** HR departments, corporate wellness pages link to tools

- **Expected:** 5-10 backlinks from corporate resources
- **Time:** 6-8 hours

---

### **Resource Page Positioning**

**How Resource Curators Find You (Zero Outreach):**

**1. Be Listed on Major Directories**
- Curators scan Psychology Today, GoodTherapy, TherapyDen for specialists
- **Action:** Complete profiles on all 3 ✅

**2. Optimize for Local Search**
- Resource pages search "[therapy type] [city]" to find providers
- **Action:** Ensure you rank for "therapist toronto", "anxiety therapy ontario"

**3. Clear Credentials Visible**
- Curators verify via CRPO register, professional sites
- **Action:** CRPO #10979 prominent on all profiles

**4. Create Niche Content**
- Pages about underserved populations attract resource page links
- **Action:** Already doing this (compassion fatigue for healthcare workers!)

**Evidence:** [Resource curators primarily find therapists through directories and local search](https://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/wellness)

**Expected Passive Inclusion:** 3-5 resource pages within 6 months (university, HR, community health)
