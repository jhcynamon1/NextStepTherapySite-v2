**Impact:** HIGH - Users leave to check pricing elsewhere

- **Current state:** Homepage has NO pricing visible. Users must hunt for it.
- **Service pages:** $175/session badge visible above fold
- **Fix:** Add "$175/session" trust badge to homepage hero section

---

### 2. Homepage Missing "Same-Week" Messaging
**Impact:** HIGH - Key differentiator hidden from most visitors

- **Current state:** Meta title says "No Waitlist" but homepage hero doesn't mention it

- **Fix:** Add "Same-Week Available" badge to homepage hero

---

### 3. Footer Date Error: "December 20, 2025"

## Priority 2: HIGH (Fix This Week)

### 4. CTA Inconsistency Across Site

| Location | CTA Text |
|----------|----------|
| Nav (desktop) | "Schedule 15-Min Consultation" |
| Floating button | "Schedule 15-Min Call" |
| Homepage | "Schedule 15-Min Consult" |
| Anxiety page | "Start Managing Anxiety This Week" |
| Depression page | "Take the First Step Today" |
| Student page | "Schedule 15-Min Consultation" |

**Fix:** Standardize to TWO options:
1. Primary (specific): Page-specific CTAs like anxiety page
2. Secondary: "Schedule 15-Min Call" everywhere else

---

### 5. Navigation Inconsistency
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Confusing UX

| Page | Nav Items |
|------|-----------|

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Lower conversion than specific CTAs

- **Bad:** "Take the First Step Today" (depression), "Schedule 15-Min Consultation" (student)

**Fix:** Create page-specific CTAs:
- Depression: "Start Feeling Like Yourself Again"
- Student: "Get Support Before Finals"
- Burnout: "Stop Running on Empty"

---

### 9. Homepage Hero - No Clear Service Statement
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Takes 5+ seconds to understand what service is offered

**Fix:** Add subheadline: "Virtual psychotherapy for anxiety & depression across Ontario"

---

## Priority 4: LOW (Ongoing Optimization)

### 10. FAQ Section Only on Homepage
