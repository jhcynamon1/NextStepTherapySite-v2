## Every 3 Days - Performance Check

### Google Search Console > Performance

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Go to**: GSC > Performance
2. **Date range**: Last 7 days
3. **Check**: Queries tab

## Important Reminders

### ✅ Do's:
- Check GSC daily (5 min max)
- Track weekly trends, not daily fluctuations
- Compare week-over-week, not day-to-day
- Focus on trajectory, not absolute numbers
- Be patient - SEO takes 30-90 days for full effect

### ❌ Don'ts:
- Don't panic if impressions fluctuate daily
- Don't create Post #3 early just because you're excited
- Don't change content too quickly (wait 2 weeks minimum)
- Don't compare to your Oct 14 spike (that was artificial)
- Don't expect clicks immediately (impressions come first)

## Emergency Contact (If Things Break)

**If indexing stops completely:**
1. Check vercel.json for redirect issues
2. Verify robots.txt isn't blocking Google
3. Resubmit sitemap to GSC
4. Use URL Inspection tool to force crawl

**If schema breaks:**
1. Validate at: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
2. Check for JSON syntax errors
3. Ensure schema is in <script type="application/ld+json">

**If traffic drops suddenly:**
- Check GSC for manual actions (Security & Manual Actions)

- Verify site is still live (visit nextsteptherapy.ca)

You probably won't need this, but it's here just in case!
