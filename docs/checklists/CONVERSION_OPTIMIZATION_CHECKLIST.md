**Next Step Therapy | Quick Reference**

---

## 💡 **CONVERSION PSYCHOLOGY QUICK REFERENCE**

**The Formula for High-Converting Therapy Copy:**
1. Lead with PAIN (emotional state, not diagnosis)
2. Offer HOPE (things can be different)
3. Provide CLEAR VALUE (what's in it for them)
4. Make it EASY (remove friction)

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Professional therapy services" → ✅ "When nothing feels quite right anymore"
- ❌ "Take quiz" → ✅ "Take 2-min assessment to understand what you're experiencing (no email required)"
- ❌ List credentials first → ✅ Lead with problem recognition, credentials second
