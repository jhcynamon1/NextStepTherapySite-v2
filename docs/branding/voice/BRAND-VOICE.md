## Quick Reference

### The Formula: Confident Vulnerability

Jesse's voice is **more confident than typical "authentic" copy**. The vulnerability comes from WHAT you admit (not having all answers), not HOW you say it (hedged language).

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| Direct statements about them | Questions as openers |
| "I don't have all the answers. But I can..." | "I can't promise..." / "I don't know if..." |
| State what you CAN do | Define yourself by what you're NOT |
| "Here's what I've seen..." | "Honestly..." / "At least, that's been my experience" |
| Check-ins only when natural | "Right?" / "Does that make sense?" |
| "I'm with you" | "I want to be with you" |

### Voice Dial by Page Type

| Page Type | Balance |
|-----------|---------|
| Homepage, About, Blog, Email | 80% Voice / 20% SEO |
| Service pages, City pages | 70% Voice / 30% SEO |
| Long-tail keyword pages | 60% Voice / 40% SEO |
| Pricing, Privacy, Contact | Neutral/Technical |

## Approved Phrases (From Dec 2025 Testing)

### Hero Openers (Use These)

**Anxiety:**
- "The people who reach out to me aren't broken. They're just tired of their brain running the show."
- "You're probably good at what you do. That's not the problem. The problem is you can't shut off your brain."

**Burnout:**
- "You're good at what you do. That's not the problem. The problem is you can't turn it off."
- "The promotion came. The exhaustion stayed. Now what?"

**Pattern:** Direct statement about THEM. "That's not the problem. The problem is..." structure works.

### Vulnerability Statements (Use These)

**"I Don't Have All The Answers":**
- "I don't have all the answers. But I can walk through the unknown with you."
- "No one has all the answers. What I have is a way of working through things together."

**"I Can't Promise Outcomes":**
- "I can't make the anxiety go away. But I can help you change your relationship with it."
- "The goal isn't to eliminate anxiety. It's to stop letting it run your life."

**Pattern:** Confident admission + what you CAN do. Reframe the goal.

### Check-in (Use Sparingly, Only When Natural)

- "Sound familiar?" — ONLY use when it genuinely fits the flow. Don't force it on every page.
- Check-ins should feel natural, not formulaic. If a section doesn't need one, don't add it.

**Kill these:** "Right?" / "Does that make sense?" / "Does any of that land?" / "You know?" / "Does that resonate?"

### Observation Opener (Only One Works)

- "Here's what I've seen..."

**Kill these:** "I don't know if this will resonate, but..." / "If any of this lands..." / "Honestly..." / "At least, that's been my experience"

### Approach Language (Use These)

- "No homework. No worksheets. Just real conversations about what's going on."
- "I use approaches that research supports. But what matters more is whether we actually connect."

**Kill these:** "I don't have a step-by-step program..." / "There's no cookie-cutter program here..." / "I'm not going to hand you a worksheet..."

### WITH-You Positioning (Use These)

- "We figure it out together. I'm not ahead of you—I'm with you."
- "I'm not going to tell you what to do. I'm going to help you figure out what you want."

**Kill these:** "I want to be WITH you as you figure things out..." / "I'm not the therapist with all the answers..."

### Should vs. Want (All Work)

- "There's this tension between who you think you should be and who you actually want to be. That's often where the pain lives."
- "We explore the gap between who you think you should be and who you actually want to be."
- "A lot of the struggle comes from living someone else's version of your life. We figure out what you actually want."

### CTAs (Flexible - All Work)

**Buttons:** "Let's talk" / "Ready when you are" / "Book a consultation" / "See if it's a fit" / "Book a free call" / "Start here"

**Supporting text:**
- "If any of this lands, let's talk. No pressure."
- "Book a free 15-minute call. We'll figure out if it's a good fit."
- "15 minutes. No commitment. Just see if we connect."

### Bio Openers (Use These)

- "I'm Jesse, a Registered Psychotherapist (CRPO #10979). I work with people dealing with anxiety, burnout, feeling disconnected."
- "I'm Jesse Cynamon, RP. I help people make sense of anxiety, burnout, and that feeling of being disconnected from yourself."
- "I'm Jesse. I'm a therapist who works with people dealing with anxiety, burnout, and feeling disconnected from themselves."

**Kill this:** "...CRPO #10979, if that matters to you." (dismissive)

---

## Kill List (Never Use)

| Phrase | Why It Fails |
|--------|--------------|
| "I don't know if this will resonate, but..." | Uncertain about yourself |
| "Honestly..." | Unnecessary filler |
| "I can't promise..." | Negative framing |
| "At least, that's been my experience" | Undermines authority |
| "Right?" | Too casual/seeking validation |
| "Does that make sense?" | Implies they might not understand |
| "I want to be WITH you" | Soft; just say "I'm with you" |
| "I'm not the therapist who..." | Defines by what you're NOT |
| "...if that matters to you" | Dismissive of credentials |
| Questions as openers | Less confident than statements |

## Templates (Updated Dec 2025)

### Hero Section

**Don't Write:**
> Racing thoughts keeping you up at night? I don't know if this will resonate, but I work with people who are tired of anxiety running the show. I can't promise to make it disappear—honestly, I don't think anyone can.

**Do Write:**
> The people who reach out to me aren't broken. They're just tired of their brain running the show. I don't have all the answers. But I can walk through the unknown with you. We'll figure out what's in your control. Sound familiar?

### About Section

**Don't Write:**
> I'm Jesse. I work with people dealing with anxiety, burnout, feeling disconnected. I'm a Registered Psychotherapist—CRPO #10979, if that matters to you. I can't promise I have all the answers—honestly, I don't think anyone does.

**Do Write:**
> I'm Jesse, a Registered Psychotherapist (CRPO #10979). I work with people dealing with anxiety, burnout, feeling disconnected from themselves. I don't have all the answers. But I can walk through the unknown with you. We figure it out together. I'm not ahead of you—I'm with you.

### How I Work Section

**Don't Write:**
> I don't have a step-by-step program. I'm not the therapist who gives you worksheets and homework. I want to be WITH you as you figure things out—not ahead of you with a map. Does that make sense?

**Do Write:**
> No homework. No worksheets. Just real conversations about what's going on. I use approaches that research supports. But what matters more is whether we actually connect. There's this tension between who you think you should be and who you actually want to be. That's often where the pain lives. We explore that together.

### FAQ Answer

**Don't Write:**
> Honestly, I can't give you a number that would be true for everyone. At least, that's been my experience. Right?

**Do Write:**
> Here's what I've seen: some people start feeling different within a few weeks. Others need more time. The timeline matters less than whether we're actually connecting. That's where change starts.

## CRPO Compliance

Even in confident voice, these are violations:

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| "I've helped clients reduce anxiety" | Outcome claim | "I work with clients dealing with anxiety" |
| "My clients tell me..." | Testimonial | "Here's what I've seen in sessions..." |
| "Really good at working with anxiety" | Superlative | "I work with clients who deal with anxiety" |
| "Therapy will help you..." | Guarantee | "In therapy, we often explore..." |

**Rule:** If it sounds like a promise, reframe it as a process.

## The 5 Layers (Updated)

### Layer 1: Structural
- Direct statements FIRST (not disclaimers)
- "Sound familiar?" as only check-in
- Concrete examples BEFORE theory
- Positive framing (what you DO)

### Layer 2: Linguistic
- Approved phrases from Dec 2025 testing
- Jesse's verbs (unpack, explore, figure out)
- Avoid clinical jargon
- "Here's what I've seen..." as observation opener

### Layer 3: Tonal
- Confident vulnerability (not hedging)
- Admits uncertainty about OUTCOMES, not about SELF
- Clear about approach
- No apologetic qualifiers

### Layer 4: Narrative
- Client examples before theory (brief, anonymized, no outcomes)
- "That's not the problem. The problem is..." structure
- Reframe the goal ("not eliminate anxiety—stop it from running your life")
- Show process, not just conclusion

### Layer 5: Ideological (Ranked)
1. Alliance/Connection is everything
2. Client is expert in their own life
3. Awareness before change
4. Compassion for "maladaptive" behaviors
5. What's in control vs. out of control
6. "Should" vs. "Want" distinction
7. WITH the client, not ahead

---

## Core Tensions (Feature, Not Bug)

| Tension | How to Use It |
|---------|---------------|
| Confident + Vulnerable | State uncertainty about outcomes, not about self |
| Direct + Warm | "That's not the problem. The problem is..." |
| Expert + Humble | "I use approaches research supports. But what matters more is connection." |
