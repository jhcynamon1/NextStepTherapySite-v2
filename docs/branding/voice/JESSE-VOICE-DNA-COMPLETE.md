## LAYER 1: STRUCTURAL PATTERNS

### Opening Patterns

**Disclaimers First**
- "I don't know..."
- "I can't speak for..."
- "I'm not sure..."
- "This is going to be a conversation for later, but..."

**Examples from interview:**
> "I don't know that I have best clients."

> "I really don't know. I don't feel like I'm in a place where I really feel connected with my clients."

> "I don't know if that's something on the market, but we can still put it in here and decide later."

### Mid-Sentence Patterns

**Verbal Check-Ins**
- "right?" (appears 20+ times)
- "Does that make sense?"
- "Feel free to ask follow-ups"
- "Is that enough?"
- "Does this answer the question? Be honest."

**Self-Corrections**
- "Again, like I just said..."
- "I think I misspoke, right?"
- "I don't know if this makes sense"

**Examples:**
> "Sometimes it takes multiple courses of therapy for people to be open, right?"

> "I think there's oftentimes, I think I misspoke, right? In question one, I think I meant more want to be."

### Thought-Building Structure

**Concrete → Abstract**
1. Starts with example or feeling
2. Moves to theory/concept
3. References authority AFTER expressing own thought
4. Often circles back to "but I don't know if I'm doing that"

**Example:**
> "Typically, we have a 15-minute consultation... [concrete process] ...I try to be more curious... [approach] ...Learning to be okay with experiencing and be curious and willing to feel uncomfortable feelings [ACT theory]."

### Paragraph Length
- Short bursts (2-4 sentences)
- Longer when explaining process
- Returns to brief disclaimers after longer explanations

**From Early Interview (Q1-Q7):**
- "Speaking the same language"
- "Two-person job"
- "I get it because I'm in it"
- "Connection is everything"

### Word Substitutions

| Instead of... | Jesse says... |
|--------------|--------------|
| Patient | Client |
| Treatment | Work / Therapy |
| Fix | Explore / Understand |
| Expertise | Understanding |
| Client-centered | Person-centered |
| Maladaptive | "Served a purpose" / "Costs outweigh benefits" |
| Failed | "Worked at one time, don't work now" |
| Broken | Disconnected / Lost |

### Metaphors & Imagery

**Client-Generated:**
- "Jar that's full" (OCD client - can't get a bigger jar)

**Jesse-Generated:**
- "Blindfolded cartographer drawing the map the client describes" (Q4)
- "Compass/finding North" - used to resonate, now feels "off"
- "Holding hands through the unknown" (Q9)
- "Intellectual eyes are closed" → corrected to "intellectualization" (Q8)

### References to Authorities

**Cited Throughout Interview:**
- Carl Rogers (person-centered therapy)
- Jonathan Shedler (psychodynamic, 3-part therapeutic alliance)
- Stephanie Foster (articles on psychodynamic therapy)
- Judson Brewer (mindfulness, anxiety, "awareness as precursor")
- ACT Hexaflex (values, acceptance, defusion)
- ACT Matrix (toward/away moves, inner/outer experiences)

**Pattern:** References authorities AFTER expressing his own view, not as the opening argument.

### Words/Phrases He Avoids

**Never uses:**
- "I'm an expert in..."
- "I can cure..."
- "Best therapist for..."
- "Guaranteed results"
- Clinical diagnoses as labels
- "You should..." (when speaking to clients)

---

## LAYER 3: TONAL PATTERNS

### Emotional Register

**Vulnerable but Not Apologetic**
- Admits "I don't know" frequently
- Honest about disconnection from therapy
- Questions own answers: "I'm probably not even close"
- BUT doesn't apologize for uncertainty - owns it

**Examples:**
> "I realize I'm in a weird place in my therapeutic journey where I want to grow and I want to change a lot, but I'm also feeling a little disconnected."

> "I don't know that I want to be an expert at anything. Marketing myself as an expert has gotten me in trouble."

### Self-Awareness About Intellectualizing

**Recursive Pattern:**
1. Gives theoretical answer
2. Acknowledges he's intellectualizing
3. Admits disconnect between theory and practice

**Example:**
> "I can answer from a place of intellectualization... That's the more intellectualized answer. I don't know if I'm doing that." (Q2)

> "This goes a little bit against what I'm talking about in terms of how I'm changing to be more psychodynamic, person-centred, present whatever. But I'm brought back to Judson Brewer..." (Q22)

### Relationship to Certainty

**Comfort with "I Don't Know"**
- Appears 30+ times across interview
- Not filler - genuine admission
- Often: "I don't know" + example + "Does that make sense?"

**Discomfort with Claims**
- Hedges when making assertions
- Qualifies statements: "I think...", "I feel like...", "Probably..."
- Resists superlatives

### Energy Shifts

**Slows Down When:**
- Admitting uncertainty
- Describing the gap between aspiration and reality
- Recognizing he's disconnected from clients

**Speeds Up When:**
- Explaining theory (ACT, Hexaflex, Matrix)
- Getting frustrated ("Let's speed this up")
- Reaching for something he can't quite articulate

**Examples of Frustration/Speed:**
> "I don't know, this gives me a headache. I'm really struggling with this. Push me though."

> "can we speed this up a bit? feel like questions are a bit repetitive"

### Respectful Disagreement

**Pattern:** Acknowledges other approaches, then states his preference

**Examples:**
> "Meditation apps, CBT apps, workbooks - all unbelievably helpful. You don't need a therapist for CBT, you can do it on an app. But [need therapist for relational work]."

> "There's CBT techniques for doing it, but just those are the ones I struggle with."

---

## LAYER 4: NARRATIVE PATTERNS

### How He Tells Stories

**Client Examples (Anonymized, Situation-Focused)**
- Tech executive: Work stress spilling into family life
- Lawyer: Procrastination, fears getting fired
- Teacher: Stuck between two paths
- OCD client: "Jar that's full" metaphor

**Pattern:** Brief scenario + what they're struggling with + no outcomes mentioned

**His Own Experience as Client:**
> "If I don't feel understood, none of it matters. The best worksheet in the world doesn't matter if I don't feel understood by the person I'm working with."

### Metaphor Creation Process

**In Real-Time:**
- Builds metaphor during conversation
- Tests it: "Does that make sense?"
- Discards if it feels "off"
- Prefers client-generated metaphors

**Example:**
> "Old metaphor: compass, finding North - I used to love it, now it feels off. New metaphor: blindfolded cartographer, sitting in front seat drawing the map the client describes."

### How He Delivers Insights

**Not Declarative - Exploratory**
- Through questions rather than statements
- By contrasting what he won't do with what he aspires to
- Through admissions of what he doesn't know
- By showing the process, not just the conclusion

**Example (Q9):**
> Question: "What do you want to be known for?"
> Doesn't answer with tagline. Instead:
> "I don't know that I want to be an expert. Marketing myself as an expert has gotten me in trouble... I want to allow clients to be the expert in their own lives. I want to be a helpful guide..."

### Callback Pattern

**References Earlier Answers:**
- "Like I said before..."
- "Going back to what I mentioned..."
- "I think I've answered this question already"

**Asks for Integration:**
> "I feel like I've answered these questions. Go through and read them, and if you feel like I've answered them sufficiently, great! If not, ask me follow-ups."

## LAYER 5: IDEOLOGICAL PATTERNS

### Core Convictions (Ranked by Frequency/Emphasis)

**1. Alliance/Connection is Everything**
- Largest factor in therapeutic outcomes (research-backed)
- "If I don't feel understood, none of it matters"
- Shedler's 3 parts: connection + agreement on purpose + agreement on methods

**2. Client is Expert in Their Own Life**
- Person-centered (Carl Rogers)
- Therapist provides space, not solutions
- "I want to allow clients to be the expert in their own lives"

**3. Awareness Before Change**
- "Awareness is oftentimes a necessary precursor to change"
- Can't change what you don't understand
- Understanding function of behaviors removes shame

**4. Compassion for "Maladaptive" Behaviors**
- "Today's problems are yesterday's solutions"
- Behaviors served a purpose - costs now outweigh benefits
- NOT pathologizing - understanding adaptive function

**5. What's in Control vs. Out of Control**
- Central therapeutic work (mentioned 5+ times)
- Acceptance of what you can't control
- Action on what you can
- "Which can be really scary and hard"

**6. "Should" vs. "Want" Distinction**
- Should = internalized expectations from others
- Want = authentic desire
- Sorting through incongruence is core therapeutic work

**7. "WITH the Client, Not Ahead"**
- Not the guide who knows the path
- The companion who walks it with you
- Holding hands through the unknown
- "I didn't feel like I knew where we were going. I just felt like I was there with him, able to explore."

### Values Hierarchy

**Top Priority:**
1. Understanding/connection
2. Client as expert
3. Honesty/authenticity

**Secondary:**
4. Curiosity and exploration
5. Research-backed approaches
6. Removing shame

### What He's Against (Respectfully)

**Prescriptive Approaches:**
- Manualized CBT (boring, condescending)
- Homework assignments (not a school teacher)
- Being the expert who gives answers
- Advice-giving

**Marketing as Expert:**
- "Marketing myself as an expert has gotten me in trouble"
- Creates wrong client expectations (they want answers/worksheets)

**But Acknowledges:**
- CBT apps/meditation apps are "unbelievably helpful"
- Just not what requires a therapist
- Other approaches work - just not his approach

### The Core Tensions (Still Present in Full Interview)

**1. Aspiration vs. Current Reality**
- Can articulate vision clearly
- Doesn't believe he's delivering it
- "I'm probably not even close"

**2. Expert vs. Vulnerable**
- "I don't want to be the expert, but at the same time, I don't want to be the broken one who doubts himself either"
- Searching for middle ground

**3. Authenticity vs. Marketing**
- "I don't know if that's something on the market"
- "Balancing authenticity with what's good for marketing conversions"
- CRPO compliance is a constraint

**4. Theory vs. Practice**
- Can explain ACT/person-centered intellectually
- Unsure if he's actually doing it
- Feels disconnected from therapy right now

**5. Current vs. Future Priorities**
- Current: Booking clients (revenue)
- Future: Thought leadership
- "As I grow, practice revenue will become more important and clients who fit less important"

### Philosophical Stance

**On Change:**
- "I think everyone's in transition. I think everything in life is about change."
- "A lot of work in therapy is about being okay with change - that maybe you don't necessarily want or don't feel ready for."

**On Therapy:**
- It's personalized - no single "burning question" for all clients
- Figuring out what THEIR question is IS the work
- Goals matter for starting on same path, not just for outcomes

**On Window of Tolerance:**
- "They have to be in the window of tolerance to get the benefit from therapy."
- Some clients are hyperaroused/hypoaroused
- "It's not their fault; they're just not in a place where therapy would necessarily be helpful to them."
- Compassionate view - not rejecting, acknowledging reality

## Voice DNA in Action

### Example: Generic AI Copy vs. Jesse's Voice

**❌ Generic AI Copy:**
> "As an expert therapist specializing in anxiety and depression, I provide evidence-based treatment that gets results. My proven ACT methodology helps clients overcome their challenges and achieve lasting change."

**Why it breaks Jesse's voice:**
- Claims expertise
- Promises outcomes
- No vulnerability
- Prescriptive ("my methodology")
- No client as expert

**✅ Jesse's Voice:**
> "I work with people dealing with anxiety, burnout, feeling disconnected from themselves. I can't promise I have all the answers - honestly, I don't think anyone does. But I can walk through the unknown with you. We'll figure out what's in your control and what's not, what you actually want versus what you think you should want. That awareness piece? That's often where change starts. At least, that's what I've seen. And what research backs up. Does that make sense?"

**Why this works:**
- Disclaimers ("I can't promise," "I don't think")
- "WITH you" positioning ("walk through with you")
- Key concepts: control, should vs. want, awareness before change
- Check-in at end
- References research after personal observation
- No outcome promises
