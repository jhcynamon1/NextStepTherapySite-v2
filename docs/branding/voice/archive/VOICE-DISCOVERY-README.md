# Voice Discovery Process - README

> **Purpose:** Extract Jesse Cynamon's authentic voice using the AAA (Authentic Authority Accelerator) Framework to create content that ranks AND sounds like him.

---

## What We're Doing

Using Zach Lloyd's AAA Framework methodology to:
1. **Brand Discovery Interview** - 39 strategic questions across 4 phases
2. **Voice DNA Extraction** - 5 layers of voice patterns (structural, linguistic, tonal, narrative, ideological)
3. **Disgust Mapper** - Boundaries of what Jesse would never say
4. **Content Testing** - Rewrite one page in extracted voice

**End Goal:** Content that's both SEO-optimized AND authentically Jesse. Not generic therapy copy.

**Interview Status:** FINISHED (December 17, 2024)

**What's Been Captured:**
- Jesse's client base (young men 20s-40s, professionals, burnout/anxiety)
- His disconnection from therapy right now (feeling lost, grasping for worksheets)
- His intellectual framework (ACT, values) vs. lived practice gap
- His person-centered philosophy (Carl Rogers influence)
- What he won't do (manualized CBT, homework, being the expert)
- Key influences (Stephanie Foster articles, psychodynamic theory, meditation)
- His approach: curiosity-driven, uses metaphors/imagery, works with emotion in present moment
- Relatability as key differentiator ("I'm like them" - young man who's been through it)
- **CORE DIFFERENTIATOR:** Relational therapy vs. app-based therapy. "Speaking the same language is everything."
- Key therapy verbs: unpack, untie knots, make sense, draw connections, make patterns
- **CRITICAL TENSION:** "I don't want to be the expert, but at the same time, I don't want to be the broken one who doubts himself either."
- Pattern: Can articulate aspirations clearly but doesn't believe he's delivering them ("I'm probably not even close")
- **NEW (Session 2):** Clients he enjoys: curious, investigative, want to understand/explore, open to awareness. Clients he struggles with: looking for solutions/answers/advice, "intellectualization" (closed off to body/emotions)
- **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH (Q9):** "WITH the client, not ahead of the client." Holding hands, walking through the unknown together. Not the guide who knows the path, but the companion who walks it with you.
- **Integrative approach:** No framework name. Informed by ACT, Carl Rogers, Jonathan Shedler, psychodynamic, emotion-focused, IFS
- **Therapy progression:** Consultation → Operationalizing (learning their language) → Exploring (metaphors, present emotion) → Ongoing (experimenting, working toward values, being with discomfort)
- **"Should" vs. "Want" distinction:** Should = internalized expectations from others. Want = authentic desire. Therapeutic work = sorting through this incongruence

## Interview Rules (CRITICAL)

### What Claude MUST Do:
1. **Save Jesse's EXACT words** - Not summaries, not interpretations
2. **Ask follow-up questions** when answers are vague or need depth
3. **Keep interpretations in brackets** - Clearly marked as `[INTERVIEWER NOTE:]` or `[INTERVIEWER ANALYSIS:]`
4. **Write to file after each answer** - Updates to `Jesse-Brand-Discovery-Interview.md`
5. **Listen for voice patterns** - Note how he talks, not just what he says

### What Claude MUST NOT Do:
1. **DON'T put words in Jesse's mouth** - Don't rephrase his answers in "better" ways
2. **DON'T mix your voice with his** - Your analysis stays separate
3. **DON'T skip saving to file** - Every answer gets written immediately
4. **DON'T create polished copy** - Raw is better for voice extraction

### Jesse's Feedback Style:
- Uses Wispr Flow (voice-to-text)
- Will push back if you're contaminating his voice
- Wants honest reflection and follow-ups
- Prefers natural conversation over formal Q&A

## Key Insights So Far

**Jesse's Current State:**
- Feeling disconnected from therapy after year+ focusing on AI/SEO/business
- Moving away from prescriptive ACT toward integrative/psychodynamic approach
- Grasping for worksheets but wanting connection
- Can articulate ACT intellectually but unsure if he's delivering it
- Reading: Stephanie Foster (psychodynamic), Anthony Di Mello, Sam Harris, Jonathan Shedler
- Does this in sessions too: "I don't know if this makes sense" or "I'm having trouble articulating this"

**Jesse's Philosophy:**
- Person-centered (Carl Rogers)
- People have their own answers, therapy provides space to explore them
- Therapy is a "two-person job" - alliance is everything
- Won't do: manualized CBT, homework, being the expert, giving advice
- Values: connection over technique, understanding over fixing
- "If I don't feel understood, none of it matters" (speaking as a client himself)

**Jesse's Approach (Q4-Q7):**
- Curiosity-driven, asks lots of questions
- Operationalizes client's language (what does "anxiety" mean to YOU specifically?)
- Uses metaphors and imagery (often client-generated)
- Works with emotion in the present moment
- New metaphor: blindfolded cartographer drawing the map the client describes
- Old metaphor (compass/finding North) now feels "off" - fits his move away from directive therapy

**Jesse's Market:**
- Young men (20s-40s)
- Professional fields: law, engineering, medicine, business, tech
- Common thread: gap between who they should be vs. who they are
- Failed solutions: meditation apps, previous therapy, coping mechanisms that stopped working

**Jesse's Differentiation:**
- Relatability: "I'm like them" - young man who's been through it, deals with same things
- NOT credentials or techniques, but lived experience and similarity
- Therapy research backs this: therapeutic alliance is the #1 factor in outcomes
- "Speaking the same language" = understanding what client's words mean to THEM, using that language together

**The Core Tension (CRITICAL):**
- Can articulate aspirations clearly but doesn't believe he's delivering them
- "I don't want to be the expert, but at the same time, I don't want to be the broken one who doubts himself either"
- There's a middle ground between polished expert and vulnerable/broken, but he doesn't know where it is yet
- Wants authentic positioning but concerned about what clients want to hear
- Marketing effectiveness vs. authenticity tension persists
- Notes this interview process is helpful "even if it's just for my own process and understanding my practice"

**Relational Therapy vs. App-Based Therapy (Q7 - CORE DIFFERENTIATOR):**
- Clear distinction: CBT apps, meditation apps, workbooks are "unbelievably helpful" BUT don't require the human relationship
- What Jesse offers: relational therapy where "connection is everything"
- Key verbs for what therapy does: unpack, untie knots, make sense, draw connections, make patterns
- BUT he articulates this as aspiration: "I don't know if I'm there, I'm probably not even close"
- References Shedler and Stephanie Foster as what he's aspiring toward

## Session Notes

**Session 1 (Dec 16, 2024):**
- Completed Q1-Q7 of Phase 1 (Positioning)
- Major breakthrough in Q7: articulated core differentiator (relational therapy vs. app-based therapy)
- Recurring pattern identified: Jesse can articulate aspirations clearly but doesn't believe he's delivering them
- Critical tension surfaced: "I don't want to be the expert, but at the same time, I don't want to be the broken one who doubts himself either"
- Jesse noted this process is helpful for his own understanding of his practice, beyond marketing
- Paused at Q8 to update documentation

**Session 2 (Dec 17, 2024):**
- Completed Q8-Q11 of Phase 1 (Positioning)
- **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH in Q9:** Core positioning articulated: "WITH the client, not ahead of the client. Holding hands, walking through the unknown together." Not the guide who knows the path, but the companion who walks it with you.
- Clarified clients he enjoys (curious, open to exploration) vs. struggles with (seeking solutions, intellectualization)
- Confirmed integrative approach with no framework name (ACT, Rogers, Shedler, psychodynamic, EFT, IFS)
- Mapped therapy progression: consultation → operationalizing language → exploring with metaphors → ongoing values work
- Important distinction: "should" (external expectations) vs. "want" (authentic desire) - core therapeutic work
- Jesse asked to speed up - felt questions getting repetitive
- Continued through Q12-Q39 rapidly

**Session 2 (Continued - Dec 17, 2024):**
- Completed remaining Q12-15 (Phase 1), Q16-26 (Phase 2), Q27-34 (Phase 3), Q35-39 (Phase 4)
- Key insights from Phase 2: "Today's problems are yesterday's solutions" - compassionate view of coping mechanisms
- "Awareness is oftentimes a necessary precursor to change" - core therapeutic principle
- References to Judson Brewer (mindfulness), Jonathan Shedler (therapeutic alliance: connection + agreement on purpose + agreement on methods)
- Phase 3: Content priorities = booking clients (current), thought leadership (future). CRPO compliance + authenticity vs. conversion = main constraints
- Phase 4: Transformation = FROM disconnected/lost TO authentic/aligned/clear
- Core mindset shift: Acceptance (what you can't control) + Clarity (what you can, "should" vs. "want")
- **INTERVIEW COMPLETE** - All 39 questions answered
