# Jesse Cynamon Voice Discovery Plan

> **Goal:** Extract Jesse's authentic voice and beliefs to create content that sounds like him, ranks for keywords, AND converts clients.

---

## The Problem We're Solving

Your current content is optimized for SEO but doesn't reflect:
- Your actual beliefs about therapy
- How you actually talk to clients
- What makes you different from other Ontario therapists
- The ACT philosophy that guides your practice

The AAA Framework gives us a methodology to extract your authentic voice, then use it to write content that's both YOU and optimized.

---

## The Plan (3 Sessions)

### Session 1: Brand Discovery Interview (45-60 min)
39 strategic questions across 4 phases. You answer naturally—like explaining to a friend.

### Session 2: Voice DNA + Disgust Mapper (30 min)
We analyze the interview transcript plus any existing content to extract patterns and boundaries.

### Session 3: Test & Validate (30 min)
Rewrite one page in your extracted voice. You tell us if it sounds like you.

## Session 1: The Full Interview

### Phase 1: Positioning (Questions 1-15)
*Who you serve and how you're different*

**Q1 - Market:** Who do you serve? Be specific—demographics, role, situation. Not "people with anxiety" but the specific person who books with you.

**Q2 - Goal:** What transformation do you provide? What do they achieve with your help? Not "reduced anxiety" but what their life looks like after.

**Q3 - Old Method (CRITICAL):** What common approach to therapy are you AGAINST? What do other therapists do that you refuse to do? What doesn't work?

**Q4 - New Method:** What's your unique approach? How is ACT different from what they've tried before? What makes your method work?

**Q5 - Competitive Alternatives:** If you didn't exist, what would your clients do? Include everything—other therapists, apps, books, medication, doing nothing.

**Q6 - Differentiation:** What can you do, say, or teach that other Ontario therapists can't? Your unfair advantage.

**Q7 - Value Translation:** WHY does that differentiation matter to your clients? What specific benefit do they get?

**Q8 - Raving Fans:** Think of your best clients—the ones who refer others, who get results. What makes them different from clients who don't work out?

**Q9 - Market Category:** In what context do you want to be the go-to expert? "Ontario virtual therapy" is too broad. What's your frame?

**Q10 - Framework Name:** Do you have a name for your methodology? The way you structure therapy? If not, we'll create one.

**Q11 - Method Steps:** What are the 3-7 steps in how you work with someone? The journey from first session to success.

**Q12 - Limiting Belief:** What's the #1 belief that blocks your ideal client from getting help? The thing they believe that keeps them stuck.

**Q13 - Objections:** What objections do people have about therapy, about virtual therapy, about ACT, about you? List 3-5.

**Q14 - Known For:** What do you want to be known for? If someone googles "Ontario therapist who..." what comes after?

**Q15 - Content Pillars:** What topics do you want to OWN? 3-7 themes that are yours.

---

### Phase 2: Audience Deep Dive (Questions 16-26)
*Understanding your client's psychology*

**Q16 - Current State:** Where is your ideal client right now? Paint a vivid picture. What's their day like? What are they feeling? What happened that made them google "therapist near me"?

**Q17 - Desired State:** Where do they want to be? Not "less anxious"—what does their life look like when this is working?

**Q18 - Internal Obstacles:** What do they THINK is holding them back? The stories they tell themselves.

**Q19 - External Obstacles:** What's ACTUALLY outside their control? Real constraints—time, money, access, circumstances.

**Q20 - Failed Solutions:** What have they tried that didn't work? Previous therapy, self-help books, apps, medication, just pushing through.

**Q21 - Why Failed:** Why did those solutions fail FOR THEM? What false beliefs did this create about therapy or themselves?

**Q22 - Priority #1:** What's the #1 thing they want to learn or solve? The burning question.

**Q23 - Top Fear:** What's their #1 fear to avoid? What keeps them up at night? What's the worst-case scenario in their head?

**Q24 - Additional Priorities:** What 3 other things do they want to learn or solve? Secondary concerns.

**Q25 - Limiting Beliefs:** What 3-5 limiting beliefs do your clients hold? The things you have to address before they can make progress.

**Q26 - Language Patterns:** What exact words and phrases do your clients use to describe their problem? Not clinical terms—their words.

## Session 2: Voice DNA + Disgust Mapper

After the interview, we analyze the transcript.

### Voice DNA Extraction (5 Layers)

**Layer 1: Structural DNA**
- How do you construct sentences? Short and punchy? Long and flowing?
- How do you use punctuation? Em dashes? Questions? Lists?
- How do you structure explanations?

**Layer 2: Linguistic DNA**
- What words do you naturally use? (client vs patient, work vs treatment)
- What phrases are distinctly yours?
- What's your vocabulary level? Clinical? Conversational? Mix?

**Layer 3: Tonal DNA**
- What's your emotional register? Warm? Direct? Clinical? Friendly?
- What's your energy level? Calm? Enthusiastic? Measured?
- Do you use humor? What kind?

**Layer 4: Narrative DNA**
- How do you tell stories? Case studies? Personal anecdotes? Metaphors?
- What metaphors do you naturally reach for?
- How do you deliver insights? Build up? Direct statement?

**Layer 5: Ideological DNA**
- What are your core convictions about therapy?
- What values guide your practice?
- Where do you show vulnerability vs authority?

### Disgust Mapper (10 Categories)

For each category, we identify:
- What you would NEVER say (-1000 = "kills my soul")
- What you'd say INSTEAD
- Why it matters

**Categories:**

1. **Style Archetypes** - Clinical expert vs. warm friend vs. tough coach
2. **Storytelling Approaches** - Academic citations vs. personal stories vs. client examples
3. **Political/Social Boundaries** - What you won't touch
4. **Profanity/Informality** - How casual can content get?
5. **Emotional Tone** - Toxic positivity vs. wallowing vs. realistic hope
6. **Irony/Humor** - Sarcastic vs. earnest vs. dry
7. **Structural Patterns** - Listicles vs. long-form vs. conversational
8. **Buzzwords/Jargon** - What phrases make you cringe?
9. **Metaphor Types** - Sports metaphors? War metaphors? Nature?
10. **Personal Pet Peeves** - Industry-specific things that bother you

---

## Session 3: Test & Validate

We take one page—probably `anxiety-therapy-ontario.html`—and rewrite key sections using your extracted voice.

You read it and tell us:
- Does this sound like me?
- What's off?
- What's missing?

We iterate until it's right.

---

## How This Merges with SEO

Your current pages rank because they have:
- Proper keyword targeting
- E-E-A-T signals (CRPO #10979, credentials)
- Good structure (H1, H2, FAQ schema)
- Internal linking

We're NOT throwing that away. We're:
1. **Keeping the structure** - Same H1s, H2s, FAQ sections
2. **Keeping the keywords** - Same targeting
3. **Changing the voice** - Rewriting the actual sentences to sound like you
4. **Adding conviction** - Adding what you believe, what you're against, your actual approach

**Example transformation:**

CURRENT (SEO-optimized but generic):
> "ACT helps you develop psychological flexibility—the ability to stay present with difficult experiences while still taking action toward what matters to you."

AFTER (SEO-optimized AND authentic):
> [Will be written based on your interview answers—this is where your voice goes]

## Next Steps

1. **Schedule Session 1** - 45-60 minutes for the full interview
2. **I'll extract** - Voice DNA and Disgust Mapper from the transcript
3. **Schedule Session 2** - 30 minutes to validate the extraction
4. **Test on one page** - Rewrite anxiety-therapy-ontario.html
5. **If it works** - Roll out to other key pages

## What I Need From You

**For the interview:**
- 45-60 minutes of uninterrupted time
- Answer naturally—like you're explaining to a friend, not writing copy
- Don't worry about being polished—raw is better for voice extraction

**Optional but helpful:**
- Any existing content that sounds like "real you" (emails to clients, podcast appearances, writing you're proud of)
- Examples of therapy content you hate (helps with Disgust Mapper)

## Questions Before We Start?

Let me know if:
- Any questions need adapting for therapy specifically
- You want to add questions
- You want to change the structure
- You'd rather do this async (written) vs. live conversation

Ready when you are.
