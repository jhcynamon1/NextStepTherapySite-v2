## Pre-Workshop Introduction

**Host:** Killer sessions in January. So I've got some new stuff that I could share here, so we'll do some more in January. Amazing. And while we're waiting for people to come in, I guess I can do a little intro of Zach for people who are new to the community, haven't met Zach in the community. But he is definitely somebody who, you know, participates a lot within the community space and joins a lot of our vibe sessions.

So Zach, thanks so much for all you do just in terms of, you know, bringing the vibe to the community.

So correct me if I'm wrong, Zach, but you have been in the fitness business for ten years, and now you are transitioning and shifting into being an AI go-to-market specialist and brand voice specialist.

**Zach:** You're on it. That's it. Yeah, a little bit of that, a little from column B.

Yeah, I really found not that long ago that I get a lot of meaning and fulfillment from coaching and consulting with people. And it was always through the vessel of health and fitness, but then it always grew into— a lot of my clients are small business owners or they're investors or something like that. And my coaching really is not just personal training. This is what you do in the gym, this is how you do it. It's a more in-depth overhaul of someone's life and how you can build sustainable habits.

And so I've just been a nerd all my life. And I used to build computers in like the early 2000s for a company. Back then there were like $10,000 computers, and that was a big deal. So I don't know what they would be now, but I've always been a nerd.

I thought I'd be a coder. And then it turned out this is not where my life went. And so when AI opened up this amazing ability to just learn at the most rapid pace possible, I just got so excited because this is the thing that I've been wanting to have in my life.

I'm just the type of person that has like a library of books, but I haven't read half of them because I just want to read all of them. And so that's really what started me going down this road.

And then, long story short, I just started playing around with my own branding, things related to the gym or related to my online personal training. And one thing led to the next and then got into the vibe community and it's kind of been that since.

**Host:** Amazing. I'm sure that there are a lot of similar stories in the community here. A lot of people have been transitioning into using AI workflows to producing them for other people, so we're excited to see what you've built here. Your Triple A model for authentic voice, authentic content.

**James:** Do you have anything you want to add before we hand over to Zach?

**James:** I don't think so, not right now. I've got some things I'm working on and everything, but more to come there. I don't have anything right now, but excited to hear what Zach has to say and maybe chime in if possible.

**Host:** All right. Amazing. So I'll ask everyone to keep themselves on mute. Otherwise, I'm the mute police, and I will have to go in and mute you manually, so we don't need to hear you talking to your wife on the phone or yelling at your kids.

We'll want to keep the stage for Zach. And we're going to hold questions until the end. Feel free to drop some questions in chat as we go. A lot of the community members often chime in and can answer some questions, but, you know, we'll hold the last fifteen minutes for Zach to do some Q&A.

I think without further ado, Zach, the floor is yours.

## Workshop Begins

**Zach:** All right, let's rock and roll. Thanks for having me again.

I will share my screen. I'm just going to share the whole screen, and hopefully that works because I'm going to be going back and forth between some different tabs.

Let's see here. Present. All right, how's that looking? Can you see what I'm looking at?

**Host:** I love it. Loading up the hot sauce.

**Zach:** All right, great, perfect. You can see what I'm looking at. Awesome.

Okay, so the AAA Framework: Authentic Authority Accelerator.

Okay, so load up the sauce. I brought mine right here, favorite hot sauce loaded up. It's time to go. Let's cook.

Okay, so my name's Zach Lloyd. By the end of this session, this is what you're going to learn.

This is your brain on effect, if anybody remembers that from any psychology degrees out there.

So the Authentic Authority Accelerator is going to give you the ability to use AI to validate your positioning and strengthen authority in any niche.

And I said "niche" instead of "nitch." Apparently everyone is doing this right now.

So if you say, okay, well, I can just prompt some LLM right now and I can get that right now— and I bet you can. But I think it's the difference between a 60% or 70% job well done and a closer to 90 or 95% job well done. And I'll walk you through that as we go.

And then how do you create credibility-driven content that increases trust?

I spend a lot of time on trust in this, and I think that's where the opportunity is going to lie in the future because so much of what we're seeing now is people just throwing content at the wall. And it's been like that for a while, even before AI, but this ability to trust what you're seeing now is totally blurred.

And so I think there's many ways that either you as an individual, a personal brand, or your company can develop this trust in different creative ways, but still use AI to automate a lot of that.

And then repeatable frameworks for publishing authority-based content.

---

## What You're Getting

Okay, so what is that?

So this is what I'm giving away. Okay, so at the end of this is where you're going to get. You're going to get a fully automated content engine.

Okay, this is Gandalf handing Frodo his stick. Okay, his wizard stick. This is serious stuff.

Brand strategy, content, and then automated to publishing.

And so you can literally turn ten hours a week of creating content into ten hours a year.

I know that's a dramatic statement. Okay? So whether it's a little outrageous, you can tell me at the end. But I think if you follow with me, you will see that the better you get in organizing what AI can create for you, the more you can publish and the more time you can save.

And then obviously there's a huge money piece to that as well. But that's going to be so different for everybody, whether you're just doing this for fun, you're doing this on a vibe project, you're doing this for a marketing agency. Different budgeting, all that stuff.

So I know you've got the dollar amount in the back of your head. Think about that too.

---

## Who I Am

Okay, but before I get into that—

Yeah, right. All right, who I am. I'm not special, and I think this is super important, okay?

Look at this graph, okay? I have spent most of my life closer to being a zero, okay? Than ever before. Until I turned about 25 and then 30, and then I'm just rocketing out of zero, okay?

And I can give you my whole life story. That's not important, but I'm not making this up. This is how I felt about myself for twenty-five years and everything changed.

Okay, I highly recommend you read "The Art of Possibility" if you haven't. It's called "Transforming Professional and Personal Life."

I'm living in the realm of possibility. And I pulled this out on the third slide very specifically, because with AI, we can do everything now. AI is just doing everything. We can do everything.

It's like, well, where do you start, what do you do? And so you're living in this world of consumption, and then you want to create inside of that. And so there's this realm of possibility that we all have.

And I'm hoping today to narrow that down for you so you can say, okay, I'm going to really dive deep on this one thing in my company, in my brand or in my agency or on my new project and realize that anything is possible. You just have to go after it and get it.

So where I am now, this is me and my family, my wife and my daughter and my son. And that's what changed. When I was twenty-five, I met my wife and then life got real because, yeah, she's amazing, no doubt. But responsibilities changed.

And so that's where I am today is building a meaningful and fulfilling life with them. And I couldn't do this presentation without— so why bother listening to me though, okay? I'm just another guy on the internet, okay?

---

## My Credibility

I've spent over 10,000 hours with people one-on-one. I know humans pretty dang well, okay? And not only am I just talking with them like a therapist and just listening to all their problems. Okay? We are going after big, audacious goals.

And so that's one of the reasons I chose this presentation out of all the things we could have gone over today, is that time with people helped me develop this understanding of what's important to people and how they talk when they want something. How they talk when they're desperate. How they talk when they're hopeless.

And so that helps me build this framework. And I think that's where this gets really interesting, when I dive a little deeper into some of the things about Claude skills that we use— this is what's going to make you unique.

What I give you today, you can take and run with it and do something with it. Great. But what's going to be really fun for you is to break out some of those pieces one by one and then put your personal spin on it. Not just your brand identity, but saying this is what I find important.

The book I mentioned, "The Realm of Possibility"— "The Art of Possibility"— that was a book that was recommended to me, I think, by Seth Godin a long time ago. And so Seth Godin is part of my marketing system. I couldn't not have him in there.

And so whoever's important to you at any vein of life, whether it's health, fitness, marketing, whatever it is, you can incorporate them into all of your daily tasks and then put them into your system. And I'll make more sense of that later.

I've consulted with Fidelity Title Company. I've worked within a local insurance company that became acquired by a huge industry leader. Over 16,000 people employed by them.

I've written a book. I have this personal training gym, and I've raised my prices three times in the last two years. Less than 10% churn. I really focus on impacting people's hearts and minds, and then the bodies are the bonus.

And I've spent $16,000 in three months just to learn marketing from Brian Harris. Some of you might be aware of who that is. I think he's great. He's been working in the marketing online realm for a very long time. And so that crash course in three months taught me so much. So I had to mention him in here.

And then personally, I have a 51% open rate email list. 90% of that is automated. It's a personal email list. Okay, so it's not one of my main core brand ones, but I don't automate it fully, but it's very close and it saves me so much time every week.

So those are some of the reasons that I'm going to be able to give you some things to think about today.

---

## The Problem: AI Slop

So I have 99 problems, and slop is number one.

Okay? Same prompts everyone's using. Identical YouTube tutorial prompts. You're watching a new YouTube video and then trying new prompts. You're the 10,000 guerrilla marketer, right? But you write copy like an elegant Disney princess.

Like, how can we say things differently, right? And ultimately, I think that's going to get you sixty or seventy percent of the way maybe. But today we're going to go on a little more— what you can do differently, right?

So you're missing out on some of the brand positioning there. The voice analysis, which I'm going to hit on hard. Competitor analysis. News cycle. How are you bringing all of that in when you're only using one or two prompts or slowly building out prompt after prompt?

I think you're going to probably miss a lot of that context. So this microwave mentality, it's just not going to work very well.

---

## Why Skills Over Agents

So this is crazy because I was building this presentation for like the last month and then this came out seven days ago.

So Barry and Mahesh on the Anthropic agent team were talking about: "Don't build agents, build skills instead."

So luckily my project was already about building skills and not building agents.

Now, take this with a huge grain of salt. Agents are super important. But today I'm going to focus on why skills are super cool. And we're not going to focus too much on agents, okay?

Because there's like some problems with agents that skills are going to really help you manage and fix. Okay, because the context window is one of those things I think I've seen in the Vibe Marketing community. Everybody is bumping into that.

And how do you work around that? And so skills is one of the best ways to do that because you're going to be able to stay in control and then you can execute based off a decision-making tree that makes more sense, and then you can go reference more files as needed.

So this is a visual representation of what that looks like, right? So if you see, we have the new modular skills. Okay, instead of loading in a huge MD, right? Then we have a skill that's very small, right? And that loads first.

And then what's really impressive too is Claude knows what you're typing in— in this case, we're going to use Claude today— it's going to know when it's appropriate to use that skill.

So if I'm saying, hey, I have a new client, Zach Lloyd's my new client, it's going to pull up the brand discovery skill right away for me. I don't have to call it in, which I just love because then you're able to say, okay, great, let's do brand discovery or no, not right now, let's do something else.

But it's so instantaneous. It's amazing.

---

## The Four Layers Overview

So my Triple-A framework is consolidated into four layers. We have the Capture, the Analyze, the Create, and then the Distribute.

Okay, so all of these layers, I'm going to tell you how I'm doing things, and at the end, I'm going to give you some ideas to make it your own.

But start thinking about that now, because we can get so creative with this. That was the hardest thing about building this presentation was, gosh, I really want to do this, I want to show this. But it was like, I'm time limited. I can't do all of that.

So I want to get an end-to-end system that I could give you, but think about this and you're going to be like, wow, I could do all sorts of things with this, right?

And so I want you to be thinking about that as we go through each layer.

---

## Layer 0: The Capture

And ideally, you're going to think about the capture in two ways to start.

And the first way, which I'm going to demonstrate to you, is we're going to capture some material, okay? And then I have a case study for that.

And then we're going to beat up on James for fun, okay? And do that as well. I'll show you that in a couple minutes here.

Okay, but the idea is you're going to turn a 20 to 30 minute interview or source material into twelve months of authentic content.

So Layer Zero: The Capture, the brand intake.

Okay, so you have the ability to capture anything and everything. Now, if it's a new brand, then you're like, well, I don't have any podcast episodes, I don't have any emails, I don't have any social media posts yet. It's a new brand. What do I do?

Okay, well, first off, just do an interview. And I have questions in here that will walk you through an interviewing process that you can answer all those questions to give the model the full context you need to come to the next step.

Okay, so that's if you don't have this.

A lot of people have something though. And what I found amazing was I was using about 50 to 100— I think the case example I'm going to show you is less than 70,000 words, and it gave me amazing results.

So the AI is really getting good at digging deep into this. But what I'm really interested in now, I'm currently testing, is going bigger. Like, what can we get out of 100,000 or 500,000 words, right? And, you know, that's like more than a couple books. That's some serious capture.

And then what can we do with that?

Okay, and then again, this is what I'm showing you today is loaded in one shot. It's not chunked. So we're not talking about RAG today. I'm going to talk about RAG in a second, though, briefly.

---

## Live Demo: Starting the Workflow

Okay, so let's get the boring test going.

Like this couldn't be any more boring, right, James?

But let me show you what I'm talking about. So we're gonna pull up terminal, and if you can't see what I'm doing, let me know. I think you can, but just double checking.

Okay, so I'm going to go to Claude. I'm going to boot it up and we're gonna go to— I have an MD file already loaded here. Okay, so I created this ahead of time just to save time for the presentation, but all we are doing here, I've tried to find the bare minimum that would still get a good output to hopefully wow some people.

Okay, so with the case study, it's not James, gonna be somebody else. But with the case study, I took a little more than 36,000 words— with James, all I did was take seven YouTube transcripts.

Okay, that's going to be in what I give you as well. The little agent that ran and got those transcripts for me. It's a little bit of Python. You can take that, go use that. Lots of different ways you can do it. Obviously that's yours, okay?

But what's important here is we're not using a ton of data, okay? And we're still going to get— I hope— I have not run this yet. I have not tested this at all. I wanted to wow somebody today. Or just blow up and fail.

Okay, so I'm gonna copy and paste this prompt that I created though, so we can save time.

All it's doing, though, is it went and got those seven videos and got the transcripts for me and then just got a little bit of information about Boring Marketing and from the website.

Okay, that's really all it did.

So I'm going to copy and paste that and I'm going to throw it into Claude and we're going to let that rip.

Okay? I have tested this a couple of times with some different clients and different audiences, and it took about fifteen to eighteen minutes to do so. I wanted to get this going, and as you can see, it's launching the AAA workflow immediately and jumping right into it.

Okay, so we're going to leave that over here, and I'll call on it as I need it.

Okay, but like I said, let's set the timer and we'll see. I'm probably not going to check in on it. I'll say 15 minutes. We'll see. It took 18 minutes last time I ran it. It depends obviously how much context you're giving it.

---

## Why Not RAG?

Okay, so now that's running in the background, we'll get back to that. What I was saying about RAG— okay, why not RAG?

So we're dealing with potentially a ton of data. What if you have an author with a whole bunch of books and a website and social media posts from Facebook, from Instagram, from Twitter, all of these places, right? Wouldn't it be better to have more data? Probably.

However, with these bigger models— Opus 4.5 is what I've been using, Sonnet I use a lot for this, and then Gemini 2.5 and 3— I don't know if they're necessary though. And that's where it's getting interesting. And I'm testing more.

I'll tell you why we might use RAG later, but for now: one does not simply use RAG with any document. Okay?

And the long context that we just keep building— Google is just killing it because they're trying to give all of us one to two million context window. 1 to 2 million context window is crazy.

So it's like, this is me back in school, right? Like this is how I feel. Okay? This is awesome.

We can get a lot done with that size of a context window, and I've been showing it already.

Okay, and then the cost of that— less than a dollar. Okay, one run, that's all you need. And then you can use the skills to go back, and I'll explain more about skills in a minute. You can use skills to go back if you need to, but literally you have all of this workflow done for less than a dollar and you have everything you need to get going.

---

## Layer 1: The Analysis - Voice Meta

Okay, so Layer One, the Analysis: Voice Meta. It just sounds cool.

So I segregated this out into two separate pieces, and I'm probably going to add some more pieces over time because this is really fun and very interesting when you start getting into longer form content— like writing blogs or writing like longer LinkedIn posts, things that get a lot longer, potentially even writing chapters and books.

So two pieces. We have the DNA.

So we're going to get the structure of sentence patterns, we're going to get the vocabulary preferences, the rhetorical devices they use regularly or not, storytelling styles, right? That's some of the brand DNA of that person's voice or the brand.

Okay, both.

And then I created the Disgust Mapper. Okay. I think when I think of people, I think of us all as opinionated, whether we show it or not. And there's things that really excite us, which usually shows up in the way we talk or the way we write content. And then sometimes we talk about the things that we don't like.

So I think that piece to someone's personality or a brand's personality, I think brings a lot more to the table, especially giving LLMs a better place to write from.

Gosh, that guy cut me off and I'm gonna write a post about it, right? And so having that piece to someone's personality or a brand's personality, I think brings a lot more to the table, especially giving LLMs a better place to write from.

Okay, so it's going to go into the inauthentic phrases that you can't stand— like, I hate hustle culture, or I'm gonna be a boss babe today, or what's that? Boss babes. Like I have a friend that's a woman, she cannot stand that term, right?

Whatever it is. Okay, but what disgusts you?

And then we can bring that into your content every once in a while and in a different cadence to make it more fun and interesting but humanize you, right?

And so the AI that's writing it is going to get a little more of that human feel to it.

Okay? And I left the "98% accuracy" because Claude told me this. And I know most people in here have been using LLMs for a while, and we know when it says, "Wow, that's amazing, Zach," or "That's a 98% accuracy"— we know it's probably not true, and I'm okay with that.

It's going to be way better than the general prompts, though, right? And I'm going to give you something that you're gonna be able to use.

But the magic here is what if you use it once and then you keep retraining it on new data? I really think you could get to a 90-95% accuracy of you just talking about a story.

Very fascinating.

## Voice DNA Components

Okay, so the example of the DNA.

Okay, Stephanie's going to be my case study. I'm going to talk about her in a minute.

Okay, so sentence structure, vocabulary, rhetorical devices, tone, storytelling.

I'm not going to talk too much about this. You can go really deep on these things and I definitely recommend it if you want to build a system like this or when you use my system and then turn it into your own.

Go deeper into all of those, especially with like a deep research assistant and say, what is it about sentence structure that makes content punchy?

Because if you're— let's say if you're a lawyer or a doctor, your sentence structure is going to be very different than if you are a SaaS creator trying to get more engagement, right? It's going to be very different.

So going into those a little differently will be very beneficial over time. So I just wanted to mention those, but those are like the five core pillars of the DNA that I was building out.

---

## The Disgust Mapper

And then the Disgust Mapper like we talked about— these are like the "never say" words and "instead say this."

So for my case study, I'm going to talk about in a minute— she has grace-based encouragement, sustainable growth, faith. And these are all antagonistic to each other typically, right?

So that really gives the model again really clear boundaries to stay into.

Because if you're talking about sustainable growth and getting things done, it is going to be very easy for an LLM to say, well, we need to crush it or we need to grind harder or go harder mode, right?

So developing those boundaries, I can't stress that enough. In everything you do, you need to develop more boundaries. So then the language models can really maximize what you give them because then they know what lane they need to stay in.

---

## Case Study: Stephanie Janus

Okay, so case study: Stephanie Janus.

She's a filmmaker, a keynote speaker, prolific author. Gosh, she has like six, seven books. I can't even keep track anymore.

She did senior management at Cisco, AWS, entrepreneur. She's a serious person, okay?

And she's my first client, so we've tested this out with her, and I just met with her yesterday, and she was blown away. She's like, "Zach, you're so smart." And I'm like, I'm not smart, okay? AI is smart. I'm just figuring this out as we go.

But she was very happy with it.

And so I'm telling you this not to, like, pat myself on my back, right? I'm telling you— if somebody like this is excited about what I'm showing them, and you can just go take this and use it for yourself however you want to use it, then it's going to be beneficial to you, no matter what.

Okay, if you want to learn more about her, ShineForwardCreative.com.

Okay, we're slowly implementing all of this into her business because she has books, she has speaking engagements. We're trying to manage all of that.

---

## Stephanie's Capture Details

Okay. All right, so the case study, this is what we took, which is a little different than James.

All right, let's just check in real quick. It stopped me. Good. Okay, so recently I added this in because it can easily skip ahead.

So let's look at this real quick. It's gonna be valuable before we go into that.

Okay? All right, so the setup's verified, we got seven transcripts, boom, we analyzed it. Walking you through that, okay, telling you about the phases, the Voice DNA, the Disgust, the Authority Engine, and I'll get into the rest.

Okay, this is what it's going to say. It's going to take time— 25-30 minutes. Claude always says way longer than it needs to, and so it's asking for permission, so— yes, keep going.

All right, Stephanie's capture— a little different than we did with James. James, we did seven, okay?

For her, I did 16 podcast episodes, 16 emails, and then one of her transcripts from a speaking engagement, which was her TED X talk.

Okay, so 33 pieces of content. There were bigger pieces of content and under 50,000 words. Okay, that's what we used.

And one of the topics it created was a "Digital Sabbath."

I'll bring that up when I jump into Airtable probably. So I wanted to mention it.

Now this is a topic that it had selected for her that fit her brand. And again, she was very impressed with this because this is something she would talk about but hadn't thought about talking about it yet.

And she had never written about this in the information that I gave it. So it was coming up with new ideas that were cross-referenced with competitors.

Okay, that's— for some of us that are working with LLMs, that's not super impressive. Maybe.

But again, I know there's a lot of people in the audience right now that are not just doing this for themselves, they're doing it for somebody else. And those somebody else's, whether it's the agency, your boss, or you're managing people, whatever it is, they do not know the capabilities fully yet.

And so I'm trying to give you more of those moments where you can really wow people, even if you know— us in the Vibe Marketer community— like, yeah, I've done that a lot. I want to give you those moments to hopefully wow people because I think it's going to be really easy because we are still so early, right?

---

## The 39 Strategic Questions

Okay, so we're going to do one better, right?

And this is where I said when we take in that Voice DNA.

Okay, so we have 39 strategic questions.

Okay. Now like I said, if you don't have a brand, you just go through the questions and Claude will prompt you through that.

Okay? If you do have a brand, you probably haven't thought about most of the things as deeply as you could have, so it could be beneficial to do the questions again.

Okay, but either way, this is setting you up as an authority in brand positioning right away, okay?

And then again, it's automated and you can send it.

Yeah, okay, it's good. I just added this and I wasn't sure if it was actually saved, but it did save. Okay, yes, so it's just saying keep going, keep moving.

Okay, that's okay, it doesn't matter, just keep going.

---

## The ERISE Framework

All right, so what is this coming out of?

Okay, 125 ERISE variables. What's ERISE? I was trying to think of a fun acronym. But that's the best I could come up with.

Yeah: Educate, Relate, Inspire, Story, and Engagement, okay?

And then that's going to be synthesized into seven frameworks. We'll talk about that more.

Okay, but think of these as five big buckets.

And then inside of those buckets, each bucket has 25 different ways to start a post.

So, like, a listicle would be an example of something you could use in Education. Okay, but what I've given it is a lot deeper than a listicle.

And so it has this ability to start multiplying content on a new level, and then we're going to synthesize that into these different frameworks that can build in more trust versus just following like, "This is a simple hook framework, throw my content into it," right?

Okay, and then there's this irrational magical statement, right? I think I have probably attended five different events where they're like, "I'm X and I do Y. Put that in your Instagram bio no matter what," right?

And that's kind of what we're talking about here, okay? It's the unique positioning that's going to grab somebody's attention and they're going to know exactly what you do.

Content themes and pillars. Okay, that should be pretty straightforward. The themes— again, it's going to give us this multiplication effect. And those are going to be created out of the research that it does. And then we have pillars inside of that.

And then the transformation journey, which I find— this is a big one. Okay?

This gets people's attention because depending on what industry you are, you're going to have psychographics and behavioral phenomena that happen in those clients— or, excuse me, that audience of yours. You want to be aware of those things because you can speak directly to those.

In health and fitness, we see this all the time. It's like, "Are you feeling sad and slow and tired?" Yeah. Yeah. All of us are, right? But boom. That's the audience.

Okay, so it works really well. So you're not just going to describe your brand in a paragraph.

## Checking on the Live Demo

[Whisper Flow interruption]

It's funny. Okay, so back to this.

I thought I gave it "continue." All right, this is not going to be done because I keep talking. Continue. Ignore the paste. Keep moving.

---

## Layer 2: Create - Content Themes

On to Layer 2. Create: content themes, personal experiences, audience pain points, and then you're going to come up with new topics.

Okay, the math is interesting. So for Stephanie, we did seven content themes, which created 62 new topics.

Topics. So again, think big buckets, right? 62 of them. The example being the "Digital Sabbath" that we talked about.

And then we created 15 core pieces of content— blog, email, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, all of that.

Okay, so one topic. I left this in because I thought this was funny. If you count these out, it's not actually 19 pieces, but the idea is it's twelve or 13. The idea is we want to do more than one blog post. Maybe we want to do more than one newsletter. Maybe.

So it could be way more than nineteen pieces.

The number doesn't really matter. The idea with the math is just to be like, "Wow, there's this many unique pieces of content and I can multiply that by however many I want based off how deep the topic is."

But most topics you can take in many different ways, right?

So again, the idea here is you can magnify content out for an entire year and then schedule it out and not have to think about it. I'm not saying you should do that, but schedule it weekly and monthly. Have a content calendar that says this is what the next six months is.

I have a built-in sales formula too. It's like a six-week sprint.

What type of content should you be making for a six-week sales sprint with your product, right? Stuff like that.

---

## Layer 3: Distribution

Okay, so be thinking bigger.

Layer Three is the Distribution.

Okay, so the framework creates the pieces. I'm using Airtable, I self-host. That was our alarm for this guy.

All right, it's thinking about it again. I ran it for about 18 minutes and it was done end-to-end. Okay.

Kanban. Calendar view. You've probably seen this all over YouTube or Instagram or Twitter or whatever, right? So again, nothing super special there other than with what I give you today, it's all connected.

Other than you got to use your own API keys. I'm not going to give you mine. Sorry.

But I'm using Airtable because I think Airtable is a little prettier than NoCoDB and I was doing a presentation so I wanted to look pretty, so I used that. But again, you can use anything.

I am using n8n self-hosted, so that works great. There's no problems there, and I'll show you that in a little bit here.

But keep in mind these tools are very mix and match. Okay? So if you're using something and you like it, the AI will be able to figure out how to put it together for you if you're not 100% sure.

But if you want to stick to exactly how I did it, I'm going to tell you exactly how I did it.

Okay? And then obviously we have a human review to make sure we know what's going out. And then you can automate that process as well.

Which I think is going to be something that happens in the first, I don't know, six to eight weeks after you start getting a feel for the content coming out and then retraining the content based on your expertise.

And you're just saying like, well, you're saying you're like— you know the M Dash remover, right? We all need an M Dash remover. Stuff like that.

Once you get that dialed in, then you might just schedule it and let it go and then see what happens.

And then with Stephanie, what we're going to be doing is we're going to do that for four weeks. And then based off the data on those posts, we're going to triple down on everything that got engagement and then put an ad budget on top of those things that gets us to an email sign-up, which is the main focus and goal right now for her, okay.

But that could be your product or what have you, right? Whatever funnel you wanted to go into— very easy to show it.

---

## n8n Automation

Okay? And then the n8n end is the driver of the automations, okay?

And I'm sure you're familiar with some other platforms you can use. Go for it. It doesn't really matter.

But I'm going to show you what I did.

And then the social platforms, boom. It's really— I think— I'm not sure. Twitter's expensive. It's like a hundred bucks. I think Postbridge might be figuring that out right now. I'm not sure.

But again, you can decide which ones are important to you, which ones are not.

I wouldn't say just start off by doing all like 10 of the biggest social media platforms, right? You want to be methodical in the way you do it, starting out with one or two and then expanding on that, training the AI.

---

## Live Demo Complete

Okay, live demo complete.

Awesome, perfect.

Okay, we'll get back to that.

So again, that was less than 18 minutes, end-to-end, with me even interrupting it.

---

## The Publishing Pipeline

Okay, so the publishing pipeline— how does Airtable kind of work? Right?

It gets approved in Airtable. There's a webhook that triggers it for n8n, and then it's spread out based off of your schedule.

Okay, very straightforward. Boom. Not something super complicated. And that's how you should really try to keep it, because I've tried some of those n8n workflows where you got 200 nodes all running at different times. Again, keeping it more simple I think is great.

And then with Claude, I think soon all of that's just gonna be in the backend. You're not gonna have to even, like, think about it.

And then you can visualize it with your own dashboard if you want, but I won't get into that today.

---

## End-to-End Demo: Kit Email

So what I'm going to show you end-to-end is a ConvertKit email that gets put into my broadcasts and then whether I want to schedule it or publish it is up to me, but you'll see that end-to-end today.

And then the transformation.

Okay, so before— this is you, right? Ten hours per week or more, right? The time, the money, all the generic stuff, and then you spending extra time changing it all the time and manually doing everything. Crazy.

And then you could be like my son. You can have your hat on backwards. You could be naked in your own home. You can be riding your own scooter, whatever you want, right?

So think about what's possible here, and it's that multiplication effect, okay?

I wanted that picture a little bigger, but you get the idea.

---

## The Transformation Summary

So you go from chaos to system.

All right, so the authenticity— generic AI to Voice DNA, Voice Meta.

Okay, and then, like I said, get creative. One thing I'm going to add to Voice Meta pretty soon is a contrarian mindset that gets switched on or off at intermittent times.

So let's say every two weeks we add in a little bit of a contrarian spice, just straight back.

Okay, that would be one of those things that would make this even better, right?

And so for Stephanie's test, the Digital Sabbath— she said, "I can use this with minimal revisions to start," which I found shocking. I was expecting more.

But the idea again is not that it's perfect today, it's that after a couple weeks of using it and reiterating, you should get to that 90-95 percent accuracy.

---

## Under the Hood: 23 Skills

Okay. So what does this look like under the hood?

You're like, okay, Zach, sounds good.

All right, so this is the simple of it, but ultimately there's twenty-three skills, and that's probably going to grow.

I think a while ago that used to be a problem because that was like— 23 skills?

But if you throw it into a framework like I did, and then in the GitHub that I'm gonna give you, it's going to teach you how to make your skills where they will be called on hand as needed. Then you can start working with 50 or 100 skills and it's not going to bog down context at all.

Like we talked about, that's really what skills are supposed to do.

But I think when people see big numbers, they think agents. But this is skills. It's different.

Okay, and then, you know, different commands, different Python scripts to go aggregate the data. Firecrawl, Apify— I use Firecrawl. Use Apify if you want. Whatever works for that.

An orchestrator for Make. Same thing, right? Whatever it takes to just go get that data that I didn't spend as much time giving to you, but there are some Python scripts in there that you can go use, like for the YouTube transcripts. Stuff like that are going to help you do this even faster.

---

## Checking James's Results

Okay, all right, so let's check back on the most boring man in the room, James.

So what you can see— we prefilled, like I said.

Okay, so we didn't have to go through the Brand Discovery. Got the DNA, right? Got the Disgust Boundaries. Got the Authority Engine. Topic generation— we got 50 plus, and then we have a matrix of content that we can demo.

Okay, so what do we have left? From one topic? We have 19 pieces, like we said, okay? Or 12 or 13. And then boom, it's done.

Okay? And that took 18 minutes, all right? And like I said, you can give it a little more context than just seven transcripts. You can get a lot better result.

---

## Testing the Output

But let's test this out now. Okay?

Yes, and post this to Airtable and schedule a Kit email ASAP.

Okay, see if I can pull my slide over because I want to watch that as it goes. Okay, go to the next slide. Boom.

Okay, so publishing with the n8n.

Actually, yeah. So this is what we're going to do.

It's going to trigger, it's going to go through the flow. Let me show you what that looks like.

The other thing too you can do for a better visual here is start Claude here, right, Claude. And then go from here. Code, Cursor— doesn't matter, use what you like.

Okay? This is what I just want to be— I want to bring this up, be transparent. This is what I did use, because I like having the visual projects available to look at.

Okay, and then boom.

All right, yes, so it's going to draft in Kit and I'll show you that in a minute. The workflow, okay?

Yeah, see, I don't have to do this in VS Code— to say "yes" all the time.

Okay, here's the n8n workflow. Okay, so like I said, we got a hook, get approved, Airtable, email, yes, then it goes through the email pipeline, and then we get it sent to broadcast.

Okay, and then these are the other ones I left in there for you where you can build out Twitter, WordPress. Obviously you can just keep adding on. Very straightforward.

---

## Webhook Setup

One thing I want to mention here that I think is crucial is you have to have a webhook set up before you can really use the power of AI inside of n8n, in my opinion.

So how do you do that? You got to activate it, obviously. Have a webhook. And then here you go to settings and then "Make Available in MCP" and have that on. And you're going to be able to do a lot more.

It can read all your workflows, all that stuff, and you're gonna have to do a lot less changing nodes.

Okay? And then in Airtable, let's show you what it looks like.

---

## Airtable Demo

So James has been added as a new client, right? I probably should have shown that at the beginning, but his name was not there. Like I said, I did not test this beforehand. And you can see it's doing an Airtable record create right now as we speak.

Okay, so it's doing this as we speak.

Okay, so— Stephanie. And then my other test here.

Okay, back to our slide.

---

## Who Is This For?

Okay, so who is this for, right?

I mean, it's for all of us, but if you're an entrepreneur looking to build AI solutions, right? Personal brands, distinct voices, coaches, consultants, all of that, right? You can bring this into your project, okay?

Bring this into your SaaS— like you just got a little SaaS project you're working on and it turns into something, right? You need a voice, use this.

Marketers, agencies, consultants— you got to manage multiple client voices. Well, look, that's what we're building here. You can manage all those voices in one little cute dashboard, right? Not super complicated, okay?

Managers. Vibers. Builders. Executives and CEOs— they have the voice, but they don't have the time.

Okay? So if you're relatively new or you've been doing this for a while, you're not making money— like, go after those people because you can 10X their authority and their reach in a matter of three months by using some of this because they're not using it and they're still like typing into Twitter every day and, you know, blowing through those thumb joints, okay?

So keep that in mind.

---

## Creative Ideas

Okay, so still creating the Airtable.

So reinvent the inflammation timeline. Okay, like I said, a year's worth of content.

So this is where the ideas come into play. Okay? And this is what I want to spend just a couple more minutes on before we wrap up.

And it's this idea that I created this thing. Use it, take it. You create it in your own thing.

But how can we think differently about this?

### Capture Phase Ideas

Some of the things I've been thinking about and ideas that we could strategize with are the Capture phase. How important is it?

I think it's important, but maybe it's not as important as we think. So 50,000 words might be good enough. And then you can train the model after that and not worry about that.

And then the other side of it is— Capture phase is super important, right?

All right, it's thrown into Kit right now.

And what would you do there? Okay, you could start experimenting with RAG files for sure.

### Obsidian Integration Idea

And the next thing I'm experimenting with is Obsidian.

So the tool of Obsidian is like a journal tool, if you haven't heard of it. The tool is not important here. What's important here is journaling daily and regularly.

So if I have a personal brand or I have somebody that's a client that has a personal brand and they're at Starbucks, this thing happened at Starbucks. And they're like, "I should turn that into a post."

Well, some of us either turn it into a post, or we type it into our phone to make something of it later, or we just forget about it.

But what if you're capturing all of those little daily things that happen to you over weeks and months, and then you have that in a folder that gets exported to your system, and then every week your system goes over it again and grabs new ideas that are fresh from that week.

And guess what? They're not some like AI slop. It's literally what happened in that brand person's voice— your voice or whoever the voice is being made for, right?

So think about how you can get really creative there with the capture aspect of it, okay?

### Topic Generation Ideas

And then the generation of topics, right? I'm giving you like 50 to 100. It just depends. That's based off of market research from competitors. All of that good stuff, right?

Each one of those topics you could create into like an evergreen topic tree.

Okay, so think about that as well.

### Distribution Ideas

And then the distribution— you can just get crazy with that.

But I personally think, right— pick one or two channels, just throw stuff into them, play with it for a couple of weeks, and then once you have a little bit of data on that, use that data to pick which works.

Reprompt the system to say, "This stuff is going great." And again, you could put this on a dashboard that the AI watches and then send out more of that content for another couple weeks and then you should see some major increases. And then throw ads into that.

If you have an ad budget, great. And if not, fine. Like, you're already creating this evolving content. What am I trying to say? This— it expands, but at the same time, it's expanding, you're retraining it so it goes back and then expands again.

So it just keeps getting bigger and bigger for you to hit new markets.

---

## The Giveaway

Okay, so here we go.

"File ready below." Okay, good. Review the Airtable, schedule it for me with API or MCP.

I'm pretending like I don't know what to do. It's like, "How did that work again?" Right?

So see what it comes up with.

Okay, in here we have James, and then we have content pieces.

So I can go up here— I want to get a new view for James, so I'm gonna go to— where's that? Filter view. Creative view grid. For James. Should be— James.

And then we're gonna come up here under content pieces. I did it wrong. Hold on.

Okay, it doesn't matter, I'll show you Zach and Stephanie.

So Stephanie— boom. You have all of her stuff. All of Zach's stuff, completely separated and segregated, and then you have a publishing calendar that you can see that's active. You can drop them and move them and play with them, whatever you need to do. And then you can watch the queue as well.

Draft, review, approved, right?

So maybe every Monday or Sunday you check in, you approve these to go out, and then it's automated through n8n to go out because you scheduled it, right?

And because I'm not using VS Code, it's taking a little longer to schedule it out, but it's gonna schedule it out for us.

Okay, so what do you get? The giveaway.

Now you get all this, okay? And it's all in this GitHub repo. You just take the repo and set it up yourself. Use AI to set it up. Say, "Analyze this repo, set it up for me."

Okay? The only thing that's going to take you time, really, after you set up and take the skills out— you know— is going to be making sure your end-to-end workflow has the Airtable API and— for instance, like, for Kit I had something specific.

So if you use Kit, awesome. But maybe you use another email service. You're gonna have to set that up too. But again, not super crazy hard.

---

## Final Results

Okay, all right, so the nineteen pieces of the content are in Airtable. I just showed you that.

50 strategic topics created.

So now we can just reprompt and say, "Hey, it's two weeks from Christmas"— or whatever it is, a little less than two weeks from Christmas— "I need content for that time." I'm just gonna say that with Whisper, right?

Okay.

And then it's going to use those topics strategically based off of what you're doing in your content calendar.

Okay? And then to polish it off— in Kit, I didn't have to refresh. "We cut marketing costs by 97%."

Okay? It's not looking pretty. So with Stephanie's— Stephanie's, it's looking pretty.

Okay, so one more step I have to make for James specifically, and I'll have to add that into a skill so that doesn't happen again.

But technically, I left that out because James and the way that he writes and the way that he organizes his emails is probably going to be different than Stephanie. Same thing with emojis used, all that stuff.

Okay, so again, that's an easy fix. But the idea is— look here, it's better, it's in there, ready to go broadcast and be scheduled through Airtable.

---

## Technical Stack Summary

Okay, and then— boom— technical stack: Claude Sonnet 4, 4.5, Gemini 2.5 and 3. Those are like— those are my favorite right now. That's what I'm using the most.

n8n, Airtable. Use NoCoDB if you want. Whatever.

But ultimately that's all that was used to do this, and then obviously any of the social media platforms you need. So pretty straight to the point. I really tried to minimize the tools being used to make it simple so anybody could do it.

---

## Q&A Session

So questions? Merry Christmas, guys. Good stuff. All the time.

Thanks for being here. I really appreciate all of your time. Your time is the most valuable thing you have, and I'm super grateful you chose to spend it with me.

Back to Anne. Back to the stage, Anne.

---

### Question: Show Us Some Tweets

**Host:** Can you show us like a couple of tweets maybe that they came up with for James? Curious minds want to know.

**Zach:** Yes. Okay, so let's see. How do I— great, okay. So the content— what's on Twitter, LinkedIn, where's the blog? The email. There we go, the email.

Okay, so let's pull this out real quick because I'm not great with Airtable.

Okay, so this is the short and sweet of the email. "Since you shared your 15K to $400 workflow story, I've got hundreds of messages, most boil down to one question: Is this really possible for my business? Answer: Yes, but not overnight. Here's what I've learned— three customer profiles."

So this data is what needs to be added in that is not in there because James is my test case. So ideally with Stephanie, this is what was different with her emails actually.

So— one sec— "The Gift of Disconnection." Here we go. Email.

Okay, so hers was formatted better as well, but that's besides the point.

"The best gift I gave my family— I want to tell you about the cheapest, most impactful..."

That should be the same way. Is that the same email newsletter? Hold on, let me go to the calendar, make sure it's published. Thank you.

Okay, scheduled. Okay, there we go. Because there was a blog article. That's interesting. I need to check that. I'm not sure what happened there.

Okay, so with James, like I said, the downside to using only seven transcripts and checking the website was it didn't have full context of how he's writing posts, how he's writing emails.

So emails is probably one of the worst ways to look at it, actually, now that I think of it on the fly.

But the Twitter post: "AI will be replacing marketing teams. Wrong. AI replaces the boring parts— keyword research, first drafts. Humans keep the important parts— strategy, quality, relationships."

"We cut costs 97% without cutting quality."

So that specifically to you, James, I mean, what do you think? It's not super targeted. But like I said, that's kind of the point, right?

We only used seven transcripts. It's capturing your brand. It understands "the boring." It's highlighting "boring."

I think that's fancy. Yep.

---

### James's Response

**James:** No, I think it's great. Yeah, I think that, you know, with writing and stuff like that— for me personally, if it gets me 80% of the way there, I kind of, you know, use it to get concepts, hooks, get the format down, and then I can get in there and quickly sort of iterate on it, you know, get something that I'm ready to publish.

So definitely, yeah, I think this is all really good stuff.

**Zach:** Thank you.

And again, like you're saying too, like if it gets you 80%, I really believe that with slight tweaks over time— for instance, if you just focused on Twitter or you just focus on email— it's going to pick up those tweaks really well.

And that's what I've been doing inside of my email myself that I've been testing, and that's where I'm really seeing the great results.

So like, if I was going to take time to redo an email or revise an email that I wrote, it probably take me about 10-15 minutes.

And now it's just a matter of five minutes and personalizing it a little bit or not at all, depending on the brand.

Obviously, that's going to be very different. Because like I said, if it's a personal brand, then you're probably going to want to sprinkle in some more of your personality into it.

But again, that's where I think it's going to be very interesting if you start capturing that voice of yours throughout the week and then let AI view that locally on your computer.

---

### Skills and MCPs Discussion

**James:** Yeah. I was just going to add kind of like a meta point here. Like, basically what I have sort of found is— like, skills, like setting up these skills and, you know, having some MCPs in the mix.

Like you have your entire kind of cockpit, if you will, where you can do pretty much anything. You know, you can create content. You can refine your skills as you go. You can pull in research.

And I much prefer working in that style of just kind of like vibing back and forth with the model versus having like very linear kind of like workflows or whatever.

So I think we're seeing a shift happen in real time from, you know, workflow-based stuff into MCPs, skills, and like vibe marketing use cases are getting stronger and stronger that way.

So yeah, super interesting times.

**Zach:** Definitely.

---

### Question: Proofreading Posts

**Host:** So we have some questions. Let's see. Saymal— I'm not sure if I said that correctly— asked if you are proofreading everything, every scheduled post before it goes out.

**Zach:** Yeah. So that's where I think, like I said, it's going to get really nitty-gritty down to the brand.

I'm more of a risk taker, so I'd rather throw, you know, 100 things at the wall and then see what sticks and then reiterate because the internet is so short-sighted that you make a couple mistakes or whatever, like maybe a couple people notice, but really nobody's going to notice.

So that's where I personally go with it.

However, Stephanie is not going to be like that. So she actually really doesn't like that people are using AI to write. You know, she's an author, she's written over seven books. She doesn't like it.

However, she sees that the expansion of reach and content and getting out there will bring more of an audience, and then you can be more authentic within that audience.

She sees the value in that.

So it's going to be a person-to-person thing, and I'm more excited to keep testing this over the next couple of weeks because I think there is going to be this— I don't know— critical mass point where you don't need to revise everything.

And again, is there a difference between one little off Twitter post versus an email that somebody's going to spend five minutes of their time reading? Probably.

So personally, I would read emails and revise emails more than I would like a Twitter post or an Instagram post.

---

### Question: Podcast Transcripts - Cleaning

**Host:** Question from Tom: Are you taking podcast transcripts as-is, or are you cleaning them so that it's only the client's words, tone, et cetera?

**Zach:** Yeah. So with podcasts, I take the whole thing because I think there's interesting context within the conversation from the other person.

Obviously, it's going to depend a little bit on the podcast. If there's a podcaster that doesn't talk very much and they just ask pointed questions and you're trying to get the guest, then the guest would be all you really want to focus on.

And again, that's a minor tweak. So inside of GitHub, you'll see the skills.

And so you don't have to go in here either. If you want, you can just say, you know— whoops— you can just say— okay, it's not gonna work because I'm on LinkedIn.

Yeah. It's not gonna work. I can't Whisper. I'm so used to this flowing with Whisper.

I would just say, "Hey, Claude. Find the skill that pulls podcasts and revise it to only grab the podcaster or the guest," right?

And then you could say, "Make two— one for the guests, one for the podcaster"— however you want it.

That's going to be a lot easier way to do that as well.

So that's what I would say. Does that answer that question?

---

### Question: Interview Questions Location

**Host:** Yeah, I think so. Tom, feel free to raise your hand if you want to come up on stage and elaborate on that question.

Let's see. Lucy asked if you could show an example of a blog post. Are they optimized? Do they show experience, expertise of the author?

**Zach:** Yes. So let's look at Stephanie real quick. Did I give her a blog post?

There we go— blog posts. So this is an example of— I didn't fully do all of Stephanie's stuff yet. Let me see.

Actually. You know what? Let's just do it right now. Check on Stephanie's blog posts and write one for her. We're not posting to blogs yet, so I can't show you a very good example right off the bat.

Sorry, but let's say it's 1,200 words and see what we come up with there. That'll be a better one. And then we'll come back to that question while it writes it.

Okay. Yeah.

**Host:** A few people have asked about the interview questions that you referenced earlier in the presentation. Are they in your GitHub?

**Zach:** Yes, they are. But I'm gonna find it faster this way.

Skills. Don't think it's in here. Generate topics. One second, we'll find it.

---

### Question: Getting Started for Beginners

**Host:** So Aaron asked— he hasn't done much vibe marketing, so some of this is over his head. He doesn't use Claude Code or GitHub or n8n, so what's the quickest way to get started?

So Aaron, I'll just kind of kick off a quick answer to that. The tool doesn't really matter. You know? It's really thinking about the process overall and then finding a tool that you feel comfortable using.

We are going to have a session on January 15th with Adam Sandler, who I think is here in the audience today. He will be taking us through a very beginner session on how to get Claude Code set up. What are skills? What are agents? There are a lot of people in the community who really lend a lot of time to helping people— you know, if they're at the beginning and they're just getting started.

And I think James has some resources, too, that he's been playing around with.

James, you have anything else you want to add to that?

---

### James's Explanation of Claude Code

**James:** Yeah. So, you know, Claude Code is basically, you know, a super smart Claude agent that lives in a terminal. So what you see here on Zach's screen, it looks like he's in Cursor or VS Code or something like that, which is an IDE.

Now typically developers use it, right? It has the local files for a project, whether that's like code or access to a database or whatever.

And Claude Code can, you know, control and manipulate and build within this environment. For marketing, you don't even have to think about, like, development. It's just a place where you can create documentation, documents like what Zach is showing.

So .md is just like a text doc.

And you have access to skills, which are essentially sets of instructions that you can build and save. So that when you prompt Claude in a certain way and you're like, "Hey, write a blog post," it has a set process or set of instructions along with references and things like that it can go and pull from to give you consistent quality outputs each time.

MCPs are essentially like third-party software tools— I can give you an example, like there's an MCP for a website called Glyph. Glyph has these like creative workflows. It's like, "Hey, make an image with a banana and then animate it with, you know, a video model."

You can interact with that third-party tool with natural language with Claude.

So skills have the instructions. MCPs are sets of tools that allow you to do things. And you can essentially build whatever workflow or processes you want and, you know, do it all through natural language.

You can do some of that through Claude Desktop as well, by the way. You can set up MCPs or skills there too if you don't like the IDE kind of technical-looking format.

But what I find is that all roads lead to the IDE. And to Claude Code.

And it's worth just downloading, you know, VS Code, which is a free open source IDE, opening up the terminal, looking up "hey, how to install Claude Code," running one line there and just activating it and just start chatting with it and ask it to do things.

And you know, you can find some skills like in the community or Zach's skills and just throw a link in there and it'll know what to do with it and set up your skills so you can start just seeing how it works.

But I truly believe that Claude Code, skills, and MCPs are like the future for sure.

I'm going to be doing some more videos on my latest setups as well. I know Adam's going to have a workshop here too, and Zach's got some really good information with his skills that he'll be sharing as well.

### Question: Using Lindy Instead of n8n

**Host:** Yeah, good summary.

Greg had asked— is it possible to use Lindy instead of n8n? For example, I would imagine that if somebody took your n8n workflow, even just a screenshot of it, and ran it through an LLM and said, "How can I rebuild this in Lindy?" that probably would be the way to go.

Like, the LLMs can help you figure out anything really.

**Zach:** Yeah, definitely. I haven't used Lindy too much. I used it very briefly and— they're there. I would be shocked if you can't do it in Lindy. And then you could organize it in Lindy probably as well, which is kind of cool about Lindy.

So yeah, like Anne said, all you have to do is just prompt and say, "Hey, this is what—" given the entire GitHub repo. And then it'll see that we're using n8n in this one. And I'll say, "I want to replace n8n with Lindy. How do I do that?"

And there's probably some API token that you have to copy over. And then it'll just connect right into Lindy, and then you can do it from there.

### Question: Using Perplexity or Gemini Without Claude Subscription

**Host:** Big asked: If you don't have a Claude subscription, can you use Perplexity or Gemini?

**Zach:** Yeah, I would highly recommend Gemini because they're just giving so much away at either such a low cost or for free. And then inside of this, I'm using Perplexity to do the competitive research. And that's one of those things that's just like a taste— or a personal taste for me.

I think it finds better analysis on the web than, say, a Claude search or a Google search MCP. But again, that's something that you could say, "We're using Perplexity in this GitHub. I want to use XYZ." And then you could just change it.

And I think just like James said, all roads lead to Claude. I totally agree, but for some people maybe you disagree with that. Great— like, change it up and do what's working for you. Gemini just keeps shipping cool stuff, so super impressed with that.

### Question: Feedback Loops

**Gunklo:** Well, fantastic content. And the fact that you've dropped the ultimate bonus at the end. It's just like when I have to go pick it up.

So here's the thing that I was thinking as we were walking along: Do you have baked in a feedback loop from either social media— and we might need to be really specific on that. What exactly does that mean? And I'm saying that like— likes are not a metric, in my view of the world.

So do we have a baked-in feedback loop that will start to say, okay, this thing is getting traction specifically for a target avatar or whatever you want to call it?

That's on one side. But my generic question is— or my systems question is— what are the feedback loops that are coming from customer interactions? And we might need to review both of these words.

But I think I would love to see that— this is a problem that has been affecting— like, I know some things work better than others. I know the fast feedback loop is better. And I saw in there the questions— I replicated what James did with the brand discovery going to the detail of the business savviness. So that thing looks like tremendous.

But now I'm asking how the heck do you feedback loop those metrics in a continuous manner? Have you thought about that?

**Zach:** Yeah, no, that's a great question. Thank you, and I appreciate it.

Okay, so I'm just going to roll off the top of my head, so I don't have something to show you because I'm testing that currently.

However, in the community, if I can type— I don't type anymore apparently.

Zach, come on. AI Zach.

I will show you— here we go. Okay, this is not the right one, but this will get me to— Zach is in our community. He did a video— not this one. I'm going to show you, though, in a second.

So Zach and I got together and had a breakfast, I don't know, a couple of weeks ago, and he showed me like— this is what I'm thinking of adding.

Zach— Zach is actually on stage right there.

It is a man.

Zach can talk about it himself, but essentially what Zach is doing here is he's building a lead list, but using Apify.

And so Gunklo, what I would say to you is I would do the same thing for your content.

So Apify will scrape the content, and he's scheduling it out. And you'll see like last run date here— he did on the 24th of November, 2025.

So you would just tell it like, "Hey, every week, go through all of the posts we posted"— and it could verify that with Airtable or whatever you're using— and then it would give you the likes, the comments and all that stuff.

And then ideally, if you have a budget for it— which I don't think is necessary...
