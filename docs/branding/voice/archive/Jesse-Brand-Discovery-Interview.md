## PHASE 1: POSITIONING (Questions 1-15)
*Who you serve and how you're different*

### Q1 - Market: Who do you serve?

**Question:** Who do you serve? Be specific—demographics, role, situation. Not "people with anxiety" but the specific person who actually books with you.

**Answer:**

Started with university students during practicum (university insurance coverage). Lots of kids learning to be adults, living independently, dealing with anxiety of independence, exam stress, uncertainty about their future, depression.

Now at 31, my client base has grown with me. Mostly young men, early 20s to early 40s (though I do see women too).

Professional fields: law, engineering, medicine, business, tech.

Common issues: burnout, anxiety, depression.

**Follow-up answers:**

**What's the trigger that makes them book?** Examples from actual consultation notes:

- Tech executive: Work stress spilling into family life. Wife noticed it first.
- Someone who had anxiety when younger, got better, now noticing it creeping back. Affecting sleep. Worried about relapse.
- Lawyer: Procrastination gotten to "no longer workable" point. Fears getting fired in coming months. Not living up to firm's expectations OR his own professional identity.
- Teacher: Struggles with sense of self since childhood bullying. Stuck between two paths: stay home with family or live abroad. Stay with girlfriend or explore.

**What have they tried?**
- Some have tried therapy before, some haven't
- Some tried meditation, journaling
- Most have coping mechanisms that worked at one time, don't work now
- Rely on support systems (friends, partners) to talk through issues
- Common realization: "I'm not really good at this" / "I'm in a weird place"

**[INTERVIEWER OBSERVATION: Pattern across all examples = gap between who they think they should be and who they are. Jesse agreed this fits.]**

**Jesse's response to this observation:**
"Yeah, I think that's really true. The common gap between who they think they should be and who they actually are right now fits a lot with my training. I've been trained in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. That talks so much about values - the sense of values of what's important to us, who we want to be, how do we move closer to that, where in our life are we moving towards that, where in our lives are we moving away from that. And I think that's still a big part of my practice."

**Jesse's honesty about disconnection:**
"I realize I'm in a weird place in my therapeutic journey where I want to grow and I want to change a lot, but I'm also feeling a little disconnected."

Disconnected from: clients, own growth, therapeutic process itself.

Last year+ spent exploring other business opportunities (AI, SEO, building practice with Vibe marketing). Hasn't thought much about therapy. It hasn't seemed interesting.

Now starting to reconnect. Reading books and articles that once ignited passion. Feels a bit lost in therapy right now.

**Training evolution:**
- Trained in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
- Moving toward more integrative approach
- [Will explore this more later]

[Note: This vulnerability is POWERFUL for positioning. He understands the gap between ideal and actual self because he's living it. Not the "I've got it all figured out" therapist.]

**Jesse's reaction to positioning insight:**
"I get it because I'm in it" (not "I went through it" but "I'm in it") - this really resonates.

BUT raises concerns:
1. Marketing effectiveness - Does vulnerability work for client acquisition?
2. Disclosure boundaries - What's appropriate online vs. in session?
3. Building a business - "I want to do what works"

[Note: This tension between authenticity and marketing is worth exploring. The vulnerability might BE what works for his specific market.]

**Books/articles currently resonating:**

Reading:
- "Psychodynamic Techniques" by Morota (early, not sure yet)
- "Awareness" by Anthony Di Mello (really interesting)
- Meditation practice (long history), Sam Harris
- Jonathan Shedler (psychodynamic)

Recently took ACT Immersion with Stephen Hayes - felt "off":
- Too prescriptive
- Wasn't attuned to the client
- "In service of the modality instead of in connection with the client"

This is what Jesse sees in himself now:
- Grasping for worksheets
- Grasping for tools and techniques
- Struggling with being too prescriptive vs connected

Key articles shared:
1. "The Remaking of a Therapist" - https://www.psychiatrymargins.com/p/the-remaking-of-a-therapist
2. "The Age of Acronyms" - https://www.psychiatrymargins.com/p/the-age-of-acronyms

[Note: Jesse says the first article is "exactly what I'm going through." This is critical for understanding his current transformation.]

**[INTERVIEWER ANALYSIS: Summary of articles Jesse shared]**

From "The Remaking of a Therapist" (Stephanie Foster):
- Moving from prescriptive interventions to genuine listening
- From "doing" (techniques, worksheets) to "being" (present, relational)
- The realization: "The patient has no obligation to conform to our expectations"
- Patients want "a good listener and warm personality" over technical expertise
- Moving from brief-therapy CBT to psychodynamic-influenced approach

From "The Age of Acronyms":
- Acronyms (CBT, DBT, ACT) obscure what matters: the therapeutic relationship
- Technique over relationship = "pre-programmed" therapy
- Alternative: "plain old therapy" - presence and relational capacity matter more

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: Jesse identified with Stephanie Foster's journey. His words: "If you read the 'Remaking of a Therapist' article I sent you, that's sort of exactly what I'm going through is her experience there."]**

---

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: From this point forward, keeping my voice separate from Jesse's. His words stay raw. My interpretations stay in brackets like this.]**

### Q2 - Transformation: What do you provide?

**Question:** What transformation do you provide? What do your clients achieve with your help? Not "reduced anxiety" but what their life actually looks like after working with you. What becomes possible?

**Jesse's answer:**

"This is a really difficult question for me, especially right now with the state I'm in. As I explained before, I don't really know.

The answer I'm thinking of is one client who's dealing with OCD. He's really struggled with it for a long time. He's also related self-sabotaging. It's almost like a compulsive behaviour, and a lot of what our recent sessions have been is understanding.

I think what I'm providing is validation and understanding, allowing a safe place for him to explore really difficult emotions. He expressed feeling really uncomfortable talking about these things: anger, guilt, anxiety. I think what I'm providing is a safe place for him to explore these emotions, to make sense of them."

**Follow-up: What happens for the client after that? What changes in their life?**

Jesse's response:
"So that's what I really don't know. That's where I'm feeling disconnected from my clients. I really don't know. It's really hard for me to answer. I'm sorry."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: This uncertainty is important data. Not knowing the transformation might be exactly where Jesse is right now - and that honesty is part of what makes him different from therapists who have polished outcome statements.]**

**Follow-up: Was there ever a time when you DID have a clear answer to this?**

Jesse's response:
"I can answer from a place of intellectualization: 'Yeah, you move closer to your values. You start to become the person you want to be. You become more accepting and willing to feel the discomfort that has really owned you in the past. Right? Avoidance can be this really horrible thing that makes it really hard for you to live the life you want to live. Being more accepting and willing to live in that discomfort, to feel that discomfort, to be okay with that pain, really alleviates suffering and allows you to live the life you want to live.'

That's the more intellectualized answer. I don't know if I'm doing that, and that's a problem right now. But I'm working on it."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: Gap between intellectual framework (ACT theory) and lived practice. He can articulate the theory but doesn't know if he's delivering it. This is the core tension.]**

---

### Q3 - Old Method: What are you against?

**Question:** What common approach to therapy are you AGAINST? What do other therapists do that you refuse to do? What doesn't work?

**Jesse's answer:**

"I don't think I'm against anything. Also, I don't know how CRPO compliant an answer like this would be for marketing, but that's a completely separate question. I still see the value in the question.

I don't think I'm against anything. Some things feel good for me, and some things don't, but other therapists can do whatever the hell they want, whatever works for them. Right?

Manualized CBT is something that is helpful, not something I would do. I find that boring, I find that a little condescending, I find it hard - it's not what I signed up to be. I didn't sign up to be a school teacher asking grown adults if they did their homework or stuff like that.

I don't like being the expert, I don't like telling people (even though I sometimes do it) - it's hard sometimes to give people advice, right? Telling people what I think is...

I'm very human-centered, very person-centered (like Carl Rogers). I think people, at the end of the day, have this intuition - they know how to solve their own problems. Therapy just provides them with the space to explore it, understand, and come up with those solutions. Right?

I don't think anybody knows their life as well as clients do."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: Not "against" other therapists, but clear about what doesn't work for him: manualized CBT, homework assignments, being the expert, giving advice. Strong person-centered philosophy - people have their own answers, therapy provides space. This is Carl Rogers influence.]**

---

### Q4 - New Method: What's your unique approach?

**Question:** What's your unique approach or system? How is your method different from what clients have tried before?

**Follow-up questions asked:**
A) Walk me through what actually happens in a typical session
B) What's different from meditation apps, CBT worksheets, previous therapy they've tried
C) If you had to describe your approach in one sentence

**Jesse's answer:**

"Typically, we have a 15-minute consultation. It's a lot of me asking questions, me trying to understand where the client is coming from, seeing if they have any questions for me. Then we start work.

The first few sessions are really starting to understand where the client is coming from, right? Starting to understand what they're feeling, operationalize everything - understand what they mean by the terms that they use, try to understand how they think, how they feel, the relationships in their life, what works, what doesn't.

I try to be more curious, I try to ask a lot of questions. I like to use metaphors and imagery to work with the client. Continually working through images and metaphors, right? Working with emotion in the present - what they're feeling in session, how do they feel when we talk about certain things. Learning to be okay with experiencing and be curious and willing to feel a lot of these really uncomfortable feelings."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: Clear process emerging: curiosity-driven, uses metaphors/imagery (distinctive), works with emotion in the present moment, operationalizes client's language. Person-centered with ACT elements (willingness, being with discomfort) but exploratory rather than prescriptive.]**

**Follow-up: Example of metaphor/imagery you've used?**

Jesse's response:
"A metaphor a client came up with was feeling like their life was a jar, right? And it was full and they had come to ask me how they can get a bigger jar, right? And we worked through that and sort of realized it's not possible to get a bigger jar. But what we can do is examine the jar, understand the limits of the jar. What's in the jar? Why is it in the jar? How did it get in the jar? What would he like to be in the jar? And what isn't in the jar? Stuff like that.

I think metaphors and imagery is a big part of a lot of therapy. I don't know if that's distinctive of my approach, but for sure it is a big part of my approach."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: Client brought the metaphor, not Jesse. Client wanted a "bigger jar" (fix it), Jesse helped explore the jar itself (understand it). Questions, not solutions. This is person-centered in action.]**

---

### Q5 - Competitive Alternatives: What would they do instead?

**Question:** If you didn't exist, what would your clients do instead? Include everything - other therapists, apps, books, medication, just pushing through. What are they choosing you OVER?

**Jesse's answer:**

"I think yeah, see other therapists. I don't think it'd be a big deal if I didn't exist. Which is probably not a good answer that you're looking for. But I think there are many great therapists out there.

They're choosing me over other therapies, they're choosing me over their coping mechanisms: drinking, being on their phone, oversharing with their wives. But also healthy coping mechanisms: social support, working out, reading, meditating, journaling, all that stuff."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: Honest about not seeing himself as special. Identifies both unhealthy coping (drinking, phone, oversharing with partners) and healthy coping (exercise, meditation, journaling) as alternatives.]**

**Follow-up: Why do they pick YOU specifically over those alternatives?**

Jesse's response:
"From my experience, I think people pick me because I'm similar to them. I'm a young man, I've been through it, I deal with a lot of the things they deal with, I understand, I work with people like them, I am like them. Does that make sense?"

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: KEY DIFFERENTIATOR - Relatability. Not credentials or techniques, but "I'm like them." Young man, lived experience, deals with same things. This is the "I get it because I'm in it" positioning.]**

---

### Q6 - Differentiation: What's your unfair advantage?

**Question:** What can you do, say, or teach that other Ontario therapists can't? What's your unfair advantage?

**Jesse's answer:**

"I don't know if I have an unfair advantage. Obviously I do on the business side, my vibe marketing and SEO and stuff is great, but obviously that's not something we're going to talk about to clients.

I think what I can teach other therapists is sort of what I've been saying. I think I'm an expert in my own life, and they should be an expert in theirs, and understand that clients are an expert in theirs. Learning to listen to their feelings, their emotions. What clients say makes them feel and working with that.

But I'm cringing even as I say this because it's a very intellectualized answer. I'm not sure how much I believe it."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: Same pattern - can articulate person-centered philosophy intellectually but doesn't fully believe it. The honesty about cringing and not believing his own answer is more authentic than the answer itself. The gap between theory and belief keeps appearing.]**

---

### Q7 - Value Translation: Why does that differentiation matter?

**Question:** You said people pick you because you're similar to them—you're a young man who's been through it, you deal with the same things they deal with. WHY does that matter to your clients? What specific benefit do they get from working with someone who's like them? What does it enable that working with someone different wouldn't?

**Jesse's answer:**

"I don't know, I can't speak for my clients, but if I had to guess, I think everyone's looking for somebody like them, somebody who can understand them. A lot of what therapy research dictates is that the largest factor to account for in therapeutic outcome is the alliance, right? The alliance is so important. I really like what Jonathan H. Shetler talks about the alliance. But the alliance is so important, right? We're looking for someone to understand, someone who can help, someone who can speak the same language as us. I think I'm pretty decent at speaking the same language as clients. Going back to answer a previous question. Is that enough?"

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: References therapy research (alliance as #1 factor in outcomes) and Jonathan Shedler again. Key phrase: "speak the same language" - appears twice. Ends with "Is that enough?" suggesting he wants deeper exploration of this concept.]**

**Follow-up: What does "speaking the same language" actually look like in practice? Example?**

Jesse's response:
"Yeah, I think it goes back to what I was saying before about operationalizing. Anxiety means anxiety to me, but what does it mean to you? What does it mean to her or him? I think it's really important to understand what anxiety looks like to the individual or what burnout looks like to the individual. What success, what goals, the person has? Like, everything means something slightly different to them. It's really important to understand what they mean by the language they use so we can use that together.

Right, like an image that I used to love in therapy is one of the compass. It's about finding that North. That doesn't really apply. It feels a little off right now, but like almost like I'm sitting in the front seat drawing the map of what the client is expressing to me. Like I have a blindfold on and I'm just drawing what the clients explaining to me. Like it's about what they see. I have a lot more feelings about this, but I'm having trouble articulating them."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: "Operationalizing" = understanding what client's words mean to THEM specifically. Old metaphor (compass/finding North) now feels "off" - fits his move away from directive therapy. NEW metaphor emerging in real-time: blindfolded cartographer drawing the map the client describes. The blindfold = not imposing his vision. "It's about what they see" not what he sees. This is person-centered philosophy in action. He's reaching for something he can't quite articulate yet.]**

**Follow-up: Can you try to articulate those feelings even if it comes out messy?**

Jesse's response:
"I don't know, it's just like I think speaking the same language is everything in therapy. I'm just thinking about myself as a client - if I don't feel understood, none of it matters. You have to understand me; therapy is a two-person job. So much of it can be like we think we can solve our own issues, we can, but we need somebody there to help unpack things, untie knots, make sense of things, draw connections, make patterns. Right, in order to do that, you have to speak the same language, be using the same words, know what the words mean, understand what feelings are present. That connection is everything, I think. At least to the therapy that I think about. Obviously, there's other types of therapy, CBT is really helpful with some things. You don't need a therapist for CBT, you can do it on an app, you can do it in a workbook. Meditation, you can use an app to learn how to meditate - all unbelievably helpful.

What I'm talking about is what I aspired to. I don't know if I'm there, I'm probably not even close. But what I read Shedler when I read that article from Bite Size Therapy, Stephanie Foster - that's what I mean. Does that make sense? Be honest."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: THIS IS THE CORE DIFFERENTIATOR. Speaks from his own experience as a client ("if I don't feel understood, none of it matters"). Clear distinction between app-based/manualized therapy (CBT, meditation apps - helpful but don't need a therapist) vs. relational therapy (two-person job, connection is everything, understanding feelings, speaking same language). Key verbs for what therapy does: unpack, untie knots, make sense, draw connections, make patterns. BUT - again - articulates this as aspiration, not current reality: "I don't know if I'm there, I'm probably not even close." Same pattern: can articulate the vision but doesn't believe he's delivering it. Asks for honest feedback.]**

**Interviewer response:** Pointed out the pattern - this is the 3rd/4th time he's articulated something clearly then said "I don't know if I'm there." The gap between aspiration and delivery keeps showing up. Suggested that gap itself might be the positioning.

**Jesse's response to this observation:**
"Again, this is going to be a conversation for later. I know that's not the purpose of this, but I don't know if that's something I want to market so heavily, right? Like I want to market it in ways that are authentic with me, in my service pages and my blog posts and stuff, but I don't know if that's what people want to hear and what people are looking for. Again, just make a note of it that I said that, keep asking me the questions. This is actually really helpful, even if it's just for my own process and understanding my practise.

Yeah, I do that a lot. Even in sessions, I say, 'I don't know if this makes sense or I'm having trouble articulating this.' Again, like I just said, that might be something to position yourself as. I don't know how receptive people will be to that. Right? I don't want to be the expert, but at the same time, I don't want to be the broken one who doubts himself either. So there's a nice middle ground there. I don't know where it is. We'll keep exploring it through these questions. This is helpful."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: CRITICAL TENSION ARTICULATED. Jesse recognizes the pattern exists even in his sessions with clients. The core dilemma: "I don't want to be the expert, but at the same time, I don't want to be the broken one who doubts himself either." There's a middle ground between polished expert and vulnerable/broken, but he doesn't know where it is yet. Wants to be authentic but concerned about what clients want to hear. Marketing effectiveness vs. authenticity tension persists. Notes this process is helpful "even if it's just for my own process and understanding my practice."]**

### Q8 - Raving Fans: Who are your best clients?

**Question:** Think of your best clients—the ones who refer others, who get results. What makes them different from clients who don't work out?

**Jesse's answer:**

"I don't know that I have best clients. There's clients who I enjoy working with more. There's clients who I struggle with working with. I don't know that there's best.

I think the ones who I enjoy working with more are similar to me. I don't know if that's something on the market, but we can still put it in here and decide later.

The ones who work on a similar level who are curious, investigative, want to understand and explore, who are open to awareness and wanting to learn about themselves - those are the ones who I enjoy working with the most. They're not necessarily my best. I don't know what best even means.

Well, I think it's easier if the more self-aware clients are right - like the clients I struggle with are looking for solutions. They're looking for answers. They're looking for me to give them advice or help or worksheets.

The other ones who are closed off, their intellectual eyes are closed, and they're struggling to be open to themselves. Sometimes it takes multiple courses of therapy for people to be open, right?

There's also the window of tolerance. They have to be in the window of tolerance to get the benefit from therapy. Some people are hyperaroused, some people are hypoaroused. It's not their fault; they're just not in a place where therapy would necessarily be helpful to them."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: Jesse resists the "best clients" framing. Key distinctions: ENJOYS working with = curious, investigative, want to understand/explore, open to awareness, self-aware. STRUGGLES with = looking for solutions/answers/advice/worksheets, "intellectual eyes are closed," not in window of tolerance (hyperaroused/hypoaroused). Important: "similar to me" appears again as differentiator. Also notable: compassion for clients who aren't ready - "it's not their fault."]**

**Follow-up: Clarification on "intellectual eyes" and window of tolerance**

Jesse's response:

"Not intellectual eyes, but the intellectual eyes. Like intellectualization is what I meant.

I think some people are closed off to their body right and in more ways than one. People can be closed off to their body without knowing it, but be open to experience exploring their body to their feelings to their emotions. Understanding these parts of themselves that are working against each other is key. Some people are closed off to that. Some people just want to live in their head. They want to think rationally, they want to work cognitively, they want to think through problems and think through answers.

I struggle to do that. I don't know how doable that is. There's CBT techniques for doing it, but just those are the ones I struggle with.

I would say I think everyone's in transition. I think everything in life is about change. People change a lot. A lot of work in therapy is about being okay with change - that maybe you don't necessarily want or don't feel ready for. Being okay with what you can and can't control.

I try to meet them where they are. Sometimes that's easy, sometimes it's not. Sometimes I find I struggle to work with them if they're too hyper or hypo-aroused."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: Important clarification - he meant "intellectualization" not "intellectual eyes." Clients who are closed off to their body, living in their head, wanting purely cognitive/rational solutions. He struggles to work that way (CBT techniques exist but he struggles with them). Philosophical view: "everyone's in transition," therapy is about being okay with unwanted/unready-for change. Tries to meet clients where they are but acknowledges he struggles when they're outside window of tolerance.]**

### Q9 - Market Category: What's your frame?

**Question:** In what context do you want to be the go-to expert? "Ontario virtual therapy" is too broad. What's your frame? What specific thing do you want to be known for?

**Jesse's answer:**

"I don't know that I want to be an expert at anything. Marketing myself as an expert has gotten me in trouble with clients who are looking for me to come to them as an expert. They're looking for me to come to them with answers to help them, with advice that I can solve their problems. That's given me issues.

I don't know that I want to be an expert. I want to allow clients to be the expert in their own lives. I want to be a helpful guide with them on this journey, keeping them focused, keeping them on path, holding them accountable. Allowing myself and therapy to act as a mirror to reflect back to them to help them understand it, give them this container."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: Consistent rejection of "expert" positioning. Says marketing as expert has "gotten me in trouble" - creates wrong client expectations (they want answers/advice/solutions). Alternative positioning emerging: helpful guide, mirror, container. Client is the expert in their own life. His role: keep them focused/on path, hold them accountable, reflect back, provide container. Very Carl Rogers person-centered philosophy.]**

**Follow-up: When pushed to describe a moment when therapy was working**

Jesse's response:

"In that session, I didn't feel like I was ahead of the client. I felt like I was with the client. I was holding the client's hand. We were walking through the unknown together.

I felt like I was providing comfort and validation, allowing him to explore feelings and memories and parts of him that are really scary and uncomfortable to examine.

It didn't feel rushed. It didn't feel scary or sorry. Didn't feel rushed. It didn't feel like I was ahead. It didn't feel like I was the expert. It didn't feel like I knew where we were going.

I just felt like I was there with him, able to explore."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: THIS IS THE CORE POSITIONING. Not ahead of the client, WITH the client. Holding hands, walking through the unknown together. Not the guide who knows the path, but the companion who walks it with you. Providing comfort and validation for exploring scary/uncomfortable feelings and memories. Key phrase: "It didn't feel like I knew where we were going" - this is the opposite of expert positioning. This is presence, witness, companionship through uncertainty. The market category might be: therapy for people who need someone to walk through the unknown with them, not someone who has the answers.]**

---

### Q10 - Framework Name: Do you have a methodology?

**Question:** Do you have a name for your methodology? The way you structure therapy? If not, we'll create one.

**Jesse's answer:**

"No, I don't have a name for my methodology. Like I said, I'm informed by acceptance-commitment therapy, I'm informed by Carl Rogers, Jonathan Shedler, psychodynamic, emotion-focus, internal family systems. Like I'm integrative. I don't know. There's no name for what I do."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: No framework name. Integrative approach informed by: ACT, Carl Rogers (person-centered), Jonathan Shedler (psychodynamic), emotion-focused therapy, internal family systems. Consistent with his resistance to packaging/systematizing his approach.]**

---

### Q11 - Method Steps: How does therapy progress?

**Question:** What are the 3-7 steps in how you work with someone? The journey from first session to wherever they end up.

**Jesse's answer (compiled from Q4 and follow-up):**

**From Q4:**
"Typically, we have a 15-minute consultation. It's a lot of me asking questions, me trying to understand where the client is coming from, seeing if they have any questions for me. Then we start work.

The first few sessions are really starting to understand where the client is coming from, right? Starting to understand what they're feeling, operationalize everything - understand what they mean by the terms that they use, try to understand how they think, how they feel, the relationships in their life, what works, what doesn't.

I try to be more curious, I try to ask a lot of questions. I like to use metaphors and imagery to work with the client. Continually working through images and metaphors, right? Working with emotion in the present - what they're feeling in session, how do they feel when we talk about certain things. Learning to be okay with experiencing and be curious and willing to feel a lot of these really uncomfortable feelings."

**Additional detail:**
"Yeah, I think that's it. I think that we continue to work together, continuing to explore and experiment what works and what doesn't. The client starts to realize and understand what's working for them and what's not. They continue to work towards their values, their ideal life, their ideal self - who they want to be, how they want to act, what they want to be doing, how they want to be relating with people.

Throughout that process, they're learning how to be with discomfort, be with pain, learning to accept and be willing to feel what it feels like to go through that resistance to go through those obstacles.

We work together to find what works and what doesn't, and learn how to do all of that."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: The progression:
1. 15-minute consultation (fit check, mutual questions)
2. First few sessions - Operationalizing (learning their language, what terms mean to them, how they think/feel, relationships, patterns)
3. Ongoing exploration - Metaphors/imagery, present-moment emotion work, being with discomfort
4. Continued work - Experimenting with what works/doesn't, realizing patterns, working toward values/ideal self, learning to be with pain/resistance/obstacles

Key ACT elements: values, willingness, being with discomfort. Key person-centered elements: client realizes what works for them (not told). Process is collaborative: "we work together to find what works."]**

**Follow-up: Difference between "should be" vs. "want to be"**

Jesse's response:

"Yes, exactly. That's a good question. I think there's oftentimes, I think I misspoke, right? In question one, I think I meant more want to be. I think should is a really important word in therapy. Expectations from others that sometimes get internalized within themselves of who they should be and who they want to be. There's a massive disconnected incongruence that can cause a lot of pain and oftentimes needs to be sorted through and processed and understood."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: Important distinction. "Should" = internalized expectations from others. "Want" = authentic desire. The therapeutic work involves sorting through this incongruence - which expectations are external vs. internal, what's authentic vs. imposed. This is core ACT (values clarification) and person-centered work.]**

---

### Q12 - Limiting Belief: What blocks clients from getting help?

**Question:** What's the #1 belief that blocks your ideal client from getting help? The thing they believe that keeps them stuck and prevents them from reaching out.

**Jesse's answer:**

"I really don't know. I don't feel like I'm in a place where I really feel connected with my clients. Like I said, I took some time off and I'm back at it now. I think there's still a stigma around therapy. I think people think, 'I don't know.' A lot of my clients are men. I'm not really sure."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: Jesse doesn't have a clear answer - consistent with his expressed disconnection from clients right now. Started to mention stigma around therapy for men but couldn't complete the thought. The uncertainty itself is authentic data about where he is currently.]**

---

### Q13 - Objections: What stops people from booking?

**Question:** What objections do people have about therapy, about virtual therapy, or about working with you specifically? What do they say or think that stops them from booking?

**Jesse's answer:**

"I don't know. I don't think they're honest with me about those things. I think if they have those preconceptions or thoughts or worries, they don't really share them.

Insurance is a big thing. People oftentimes bring up insurance just confirming that I can work with their insurance. I tell them every time, most insurance in Ontario, private insurance covers therapy with psychotherapists, they just have to confirm. That's about it, I think.

Our next is making sure I can meet them at times that they can meet. Some people want in-person therapy. I only offer virtual right now, but I think most are okay with virtual given their schedules, at least the people I work with."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: Honest admission that clients don't share their real objections/preconceptions with him. The practical objections he does hear: (1) Insurance coverage - he confirms most Ontario private insurance covers psychotherapists, (2) Scheduling/availability, (3) Virtual vs. in-person preference - though most accept virtual given their schedules. These are logistical objections, not philosophical ones about therapy itself.]**

### Q14 - Known For: What's your reputation?

**Question:** What do you want to be known for? If someone's googling "therapist who..." - what comes after? What's the specific thing you want your reputation to be about?

**Jesse's answer:**

"I want to be known as somebody who helps people help themselves, not somebody who gives the answers, assigns homework, or tells people what I think they should do. But somebody who really helps people discover themselves, find themselves, understand themselves, be okay with themselves, be okay with difficult emotions, learn to live and be accepting and willing and more in line with their values."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: Clear positive articulation of what he wants to be known FOR (vs. Q9 which was more about what he's against). Key positioning: "Helps people help themselves" - not giving answers/homework/direction. Helps clients discover/find/understand themselves, be okay with difficult emotions, live accepting and willing, align with values. This is person-centered (Rogers: client has their own answers) + ACT (acceptance, willingness, values) synthesis.]**

### Q15 - Content Pillars: What topics do you want to own?

**Question:** What topics do you want to own? 3-7 themes that are distinctly yours - the subjects you want to be associated with, that you could talk about endlessly, that set you apart.

**Jesse's answer:**

"I don't know. Working with university students, working with men, working with professionals, lawyers. Stuff like that."

**Follow-up: What about topics/themes vs. audiences?**

"Anxiety, burnout, values, acceptance, difficult emotions, should vs. want, being with discomfort - all of those things. Yeah, for sure, I think those are all a part of what I want to work with. Purpose, meaning, self-acceptance, self-compassion, self-understanding, life transitions, all that stuff too."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: Content pillars identified:
- **Audiences:** University students, men, professionals (especially lawyers)
- **Topics/Themes:**
  - Anxiety
  - Burnout
  - Values
  - Acceptance
  - Difficult emotions
  - "Should" vs. "want" (expectations vs. authentic desire)
  - Being with discomfort
  - Purpose & meaning
  - Self-acceptance, self-compassion, self-understanding
  - Life transitions

These align with his ACT + person-centered approach and the "WITH you, not ahead of you" positioning. The "should vs. want" distinction is particularly distinctive to his therapeutic philosophy.]**

## PHASE 2: AUDIENCE DEEP DIVE (Questions 16-26)
*Understanding client psychology*

### Q16 & Q17 - Current State vs. Desired State

**Q16:** Where is your ideal client RIGHT NOW? What's their day like? What are they feeling? What made them finally google "therapist"?

**Q17:** Where do they want to be? What does life look like when therapy is working?

**Jesse's answer:**

"My ideal client is either at university or at work. They're feeling not themselves. They're feeling a little disconnected from themselves. They're overworked, overtired, anxious, and stressed. They know what it feels like to feel good, but they're not feeling that way right now. They don't know why they're not feeling that way, and they don't know where they want to be. They've been there before, but they're not there right now."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: Strong answer for Q16 (current state): At university/work, feeling disconnected from themselves, overworked/overtired/anxious/stressed. Key insight: "They know what it feels like to feel good, but they're not feeling that way right now" - they've been there before but lost it. For Q17 (desired state): Jesse said "they don't know where they want to be" - which is itself an answer. The desired state might BE figuring out where they want to be, reconnecting with that feeling of "good" they've lost.]**

---

### Q18 & Q19 - Internal vs. External Obstacles

**Q18:** What do they THINK is holding them back? (The stories they tell themselves)

**Q19:** What's ACTUALLY outside their control? (Real constraints - time, money, circumstances)

**Jesse's answer:**

"Yeah, stories they tell themselves, critic and inner critic. Sometimes it's an internalized voice from somebody in their childhood. Maybe there's a disconnect between their values, right? Like I know I've said I'm moving away from ACT, but I'm brought to the idea of the ACT Matrix, right? Like looking at the ACT Matrix, I think could be really helpful. In some cases, it's something I like using with clients, but something I like conceptualizing, right? Like there's a way of moving and toward moves. There's inner experiences and there's outer experiences, right? And understanding each of the four quadrants, I think can be really helpful. Working with the ACT Matrix, understanding all that stuff. I don't know if that makes sense. Feel free to ask follow-up questions.

Oh, I didn't see you specify what they think is holding them back vs. what's actually holding them back. Yeah, I don't know. Do with my answer what you will. Ask me follow-ups."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: Jesse talked more about his therapeutic approach (ACT Matrix - 4 quadrants: toward/away moves, inner/outer experiences) than directly answering the question. He mentioned inner critic, internalized childhood voices, disconnect from values. Didn't distinguish between Q18 (stories) vs. Q19 (actual constraints). The ACT Matrix reference is interesting - even though he's "moving away from ACT," he still finds the conceptual framework useful for understanding client experiences.]**

**Follow-up clarification:**

"They oftentimes externalize it, right? Like, it's things out of their control: it's their boss, it's their spouse, it's their ADHD, it's something that is coming in and affecting them that they don't have control over, and that's what they're saying is the problem.

Demanding job, family obligations, money stress - all of that is true. I think it's about learning what's in your control and what's out of your control, learning to do with what's in your control what you want to do with it, but also learning to accept and be okay with what's not in your control, which can be really scary and hard."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: Clear distinction now. Q18 (what they think): They externalize - boss, spouse, ADHD, things outside their control. Q19 (actual constraints): Demanding job, family obligations, money stress (all real). The therapeutic work: learning what's in vs. out of control, acting on what you can control, accepting what you can't. This is core ACT philosophy even as he moves away from prescriptive ACT techniques.]**

### Q20 & Q21 - Failed Solutions + Why They Failed

**Q20:** What have they tried before therapy that didn't work?

**Q21:** WHY did those fail? What false beliefs did this create?

**Jesse's answer (compiled from Q1, Q5, and follow-up):**

**From Q1 - What they tried:**
- Previous therapy (some)
- Meditation, journaling
- Coping mechanisms that "worked at one time, don't work now"
- Support systems (friends, partners)
- Drinking, phone use, oversharing with partners
- Healthy coping: social support, working out, reading

**Q21 - Why they failed:**

"A quote that really resonated with me going back to my master's degree education is: 'Today's problems are yesterday's solutions' or 'Come from yesterday's solutions.'

A lot of things that come up for people that people struggle with are actually ways of coping in the past. Oftentimes unhelpful emotions, helpful feelings, motivations, behaviours actually served a really important purpose or at least once did serve a really important purpose. The problem is now that they might not serve that purpose anymore or maybe the costs outweigh the benefits."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: Key insight: "Today's problems are yesterday's solutions." The coping mechanisms that clients struggle with now (even "unhelpful" ones) once served an important purpose. They didn't fail - they worked, but the context changed. Now the costs outweigh the benefits. This is a compassionate, functional view of "maladaptive" behaviors - not pathologizing them but understanding their original adaptive function.]**

**Follow-up: Is honoring the old function part of the work?**

"I think it's really important for me as a therapist. I don't know if other therapists see that as important. It adds a level of acceptance and self-compassion. It allows you to not feel a sense of shame. To understand why we do these things, why we feel these things, where they come from, why we implemented them, how they were helpful and why maybe they're not helpful anymore. I think awareness is oftentimes a necessary precursor to change."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: This is distinctively Jesse's approach. Understanding the function of behaviors removes shame, adds acceptance and self-compassion. Not just identifying what's "wrong" but understanding WHY it made sense. Key principle: "Awareness is oftentimes a necessary precursor to change" - very Rogerian/person-centered. You can't change what you don't understand. This connects to his resistance to prescriptive approaches - you can't just give people new coping skills without understanding why the old ones existed.]**

### Q22-Q24 - Priorities & Fears

**Q22:** What's the #1 thing they want to learn or solve? The burning question.

**Q23:** What's their #1 fear? What keeps them up at night?

**Q24:** What 3 other things do they want to solve? (Secondary concerns)

**Jesse's answer:**

"This goes a little bit against what I'm talking about in terms of how I'm changing to be more psychodynamic, person-centred, present whatever. But I'm brought back to Judson Brewer and his research on mindfulness and addiction and mindfulness and anxiety. He talks so much about how awareness is a precursor to change.

What's the number one thing they want to learn or solve, the burning question? I think that's it for every client. But I think figuring out what that question is is so important.

Goal setting, goals at the beginning of therapy are not just important for the sense of setting goals but so that we can start on the same path, work together, know what we want to work for. Jonathan Shedler talks about the therapeutic alliance as having three parts:
1. A connection
2. A mutual agreement about the purpose of therapy
3. A mutual agreement about the methods you will use to achieve that purpose

I go back to that. I think it's so important but it is personalized for each client."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: Jesse won't/can't answer what THE burning question is because it's different for every client. The therapeutic work IS figuring out what their unique question is. This is very person-centered - won't impose a framework of what people "should" want to solve. References Judson Brewer (mindfulness/addiction research) and Shedler's 3-part alliance (connection, agreement on purpose, agreement on methods). Goal setting isn't just about goals - it's about starting on the same path, working together. Everything is personalized.]**

---

### Q25 - Limiting Beliefs

**Question:** What 3-5 limiting beliefs do your clients hold? The things you have to address before they can make progress.

**Jesse's answer:**

"That they can't change, that they can't fix themselves. Brought back to that client with the analogy of a jar where we had to work with the idea that maybe he can't actually get a bigger jar, right. That it is somebody else, it is something else that's causing their problems. Right. And sometimes it is, and we have to learn to accept that. Like I think a limiting belief that's so important that is true for a lot of people is understanding what's in your control and what's not, like I said before."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: Limiting beliefs identified:
1. "I can't change"
2. "I can't fix myself"
3. "I need more capacity" (bigger jar) - when really they need to understand what they have
4. "It's somebody/something else causing my problems" (externalization)
5. Paradox: Sometimes it IS external, and the limiting belief is thinking they should be able to control it

Core therapeutic work: Understanding what's in your control vs. not in your control. This keeps coming up - it's central to Jesse's approach.]**

---

### Q26 - Language Patterns

**Question:** What exact words and phrases do your clients actually say when describing their experience?

**Jesse's answer:**

"I think that's so different. I've given you some metaphors clients have used before. I don't know. We can come back to this one later."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: Skipped for now. Jesse noted he's already shared some client metaphors (jar analogy) but doesn't have a general answer. Will revisit if needed.]**

## PHASE 3: CONTENT STRATEGY (Questions 27-34)
*How you want to show up*

### Q27-29 - Content Priorities & Audience Awareness

**Q27:** Rank 1-4 by priority: (a) Entertainment (b) Thought leadership (c) Email subscribers (d) Booking clients

**Q28:** Where do most website visitors fall on awareness spectrum?

**Q29:** Roughly what % at each level?

**Jesse's answer:**

"Currently, I'd probably have to put D first, although in the future, I think B would be first. But currently, it's probably D, B. The email subscribers is not a thing for me right now.

Currently, most of my website visitors fall into I don't know what that means. Probably problem-aware, if I had to guess. I'd say mostly problem-aware, some solution-aware, some ready to book, and mostly not unaware because they wouldn't be searching really."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: Current priority: D (booking clients), then B (thought leadership). Future priority would flip to B first. Email list (C) not a priority. Most visitors are problem-aware (know something's wrong, not sure what). Some solution-aware (considering therapy). Some most-aware (ready to book). Very few unaware (wouldn't be searching for therapist).]**

---

### Q30-34 - Execution Strategy

**Q30:** Where do you want to create content?

**Q31:** How often realistically?

**Q32:** What formats feel natural?

**Q33:** Biggest constraint?

**Q34:** Content endgame?

**Jesse's answer:**

"In the short term, website service pages and blogs are the most important. In the future, probably LinkedIn.

I don't know, weekly I upload pages sporadically, sometimes I'll add 3-4 at a time and not add some for a few weeks.

Stories don't feel good, how-to's don't feel good, none of these Q&As maybe, but also just service pages, landing pages, informational pages, blog posts based on what you know about me and stuff like that.

CRPO (regulations on marketing compliance issues) is a big constraint. Balancing authenticity with what's good for marketing conversions is a constraint.

Revenue is the biggest end game, I would say, but also getting clients who fit.

As I grow, practice revenue will become more important and clients who fit less important because there'll be more therapists to fit with clients, but as I'm by myself right now, it's different."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE:
- Platforms: Short-term = website service/blog pages. Future = LinkedIn
- Cadence: Sporadic (batch 3-4 pages, then weeks off). No consistent schedule
- Formats: Stories/how-tos don't feel natural. Service pages, landing pages, informational/blog posts DO feel natural. Q&As maybe
- Constraints: (1) CRPO compliance, (2) Authenticity vs. conversion optimization
- Endgame: Revenue + clients who fit. As practice scales with more therapists, revenue becomes priority over fit (other therapists can serve different clients). Currently solo, so fit matters more.]**

## PHASE 4: TRANSFORMATION JOURNEY (Questions 35-39)
*The complete client journey*

### Q35 - Before State (Vivid)

**Question:** Describe your ideal client's "before state" in vivid, emotional detail. What's their pain? Daily struggle? What moment made them reach out?

**Jesse's answer (from Q16):**

"My ideal client is either at university or at work. They're feeling not themselves. They're feeling a little disconnected from themselves. They're overworked, overtired, anxious, and stressed. They know what it feels like to feel good, but they're not feeling that way right now. They don't know why they're not feeling that way, and they don't know where they want to be. They've been there before, but they're not there right now."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: Vivid before state captured in Q16. Key elements: disconnected from themselves, overworked/overtired/anxious/stressed, lost the "good" feeling they once had, don't know why or how to get back.]**

---

### Q36 - After State (Vivid)

**Question:** When therapy works - what's different? What do they feel? What becomes possible?

**Jesse's answer:**

"I think they feel more authentically themselves. This is where I agree a lot with ACT. I think you look at the Hexaflex, right there's no more accepting they're feeling more willing, they're feeling more in line with their values, less associated, less identified with their thoughts. I think they're feeling a better understanding of themselves and what they want and how to get it, and all of that stuff."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: After state = feeling more authentically themselves. ACT Hexaflex elements present: accepting, willing, aligned with values, defused from thoughts (less identified/associated). Better self-understanding. Know what they want and how to get it. The transformation is FROM disconnected/lost TO authentic/aligned/clear.]**

---

### Q37 - Journey Milestones

**Question:** What are the 3-5 milestones on the journey from before → after?

**Jesse's answer (from Q11 - therapy progression):**

1. **Consultation** - Fit check, mutual questions
2. **Operationalizing** - Learning their language, what terms mean to THEM, how they think/feel
3. **Exploring** - Metaphors/imagery, present-moment emotion work, being with discomfort
4. **Ongoing work** - Experimenting with what works/doesn't, realizing patterns, working toward values, learning to be with pain/resistance

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: Journey covered in Q11. The progression moves from understanding (language, patterns) to experiencing (present emotion, discomfort) to integrating (values, acceptance).]**

---

### Q38 - Timeline

**Question:** Realistic timeline for this transformation?

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: Not explicitly answered. Jesse's approach is personalized - timeline varies by client.]**

---

### Q39 - Core Mindset Shift

**Question:** What's the biggest internal transformation that has to happen?

**Jesse's answer (compiled from Q11, Q18-19, Q20-21):**

**From Q11 follow-up:** Understanding "should" (internalized expectations) vs. "want" (authentic desire). Sorting through what's external vs. internal, what's authentic vs. imposed.

**From Q18-19:** "Learning what's in your control and what's out of your control, learning to do with what's in your control what you want to do with it, but also learning to accept and be okay with what's not in your control, which can be really scary and hard."

**From Q20-21:** Understanding that "today's problems are yesterday's solutions." Behaviors that cause pain now once served an important purpose. This removes shame and creates self-compassion. "Awareness is oftentimes a necessary precursor to change."

**[INTERVIEWER NOTE: The core mindset shift is ACCEPTANCE + CLARITY:
- Accepting what you can't control
- Taking action on what you can
- Understanding behaviors served a purpose (removing shame)
- Distinguishing authentic wants from internalized "shoulds"
- Awareness before change

This is fundamentally ACT philosophy even as Jesse moves away from prescriptive ACT techniques.]**
