## Structural Patterns

### Sentence Structure
- Starts with disclaimers: "I don't know," "I can't speak for my clients, but..."
- Uses "right?" as a verbal check-in (appears frequently)
- Self-interrupts and course-corrects mid-thought
- Builds through examples rather than abstract statements
- Questions his own answers: "Does that make sense?" "Is that enough?"

### Uncertainty Markers
- "I don't know if..." (appears constantly)
- "I'm probably not even close"
- "I'm cringing even as I say this"
- "I'm not sure how much I believe it"
- "I'm having trouble articulating this"

### Thought Process
- Often speaks from his own experience as a client first
- Moves from concrete (client example, personal feeling) to abstract (theory)
- References authorities AFTER expressing his own thoughts (Shedler, Foster, Rogers)
- Builds metaphors in real-time, discards ones that feel "off"

## Linguistic Patterns

### Signature Phrases
- "Speaking the same language"
- "Two-person job"
- "I get it because I'm in it"
- "If I don't feel understood, none of it matters"
- "Connection is everything"
- "I don't want to be the expert"

### Key Verbs (How He Describes Therapy)
- Unpack
- Untie knots
- Make sense of things
- Draw connections
- Make patterns
- Operationalize
- Explore

### Word Choices
- Says "client" not "patient"

- Says "understanding" not "expertise"
- Says "person-centered" not "client-centered"

### Avoids
- Clinical jargon (unless quoting theory)

- Certainty

---

## Tonal Patterns

### Emotional Register
- Vulnerable, honest, searching
- Self-critical without being self-deprecating
- Respectful of other approaches while being clear about his own
- Uncertain but not apologetic

### Relationship to Expertise
- Resists claiming authority
- References research to validate feelings, not to assert expertise
- Intellectualizes, then admits he's intellectualizing
- "I can answer from a place of intellectualization: [ACT theory]. That's the more intellectualized answer. I don't know if I'm doing that."

### Energy Level
- Measured, thoughtful
- Speeds up when reaching for something he can't quite articulate
- Slows down when admitting uncertainty

---

## Narrative Patterns

### How He Tells Stories
- Uses client examples (anonymized, general)
- Shares his own experience as a client
- Creates metaphors collaboratively with clients
- Admits when metaphors no longer work for him

### Metaphors That Resonate
- Blindfolded cartographer drawing the map the client describes (NEW - created in real-time during interview)
- Life as a jar that's full (client-generated example)
- ~~Compass/finding North~~ (used to love it, now feels "off")

### How He Delivers Insights
- Through questions rather than statements
- By admitting what he doesn't know
- By contrasting what he won't do with what he aspires to do
- Through recursive self-examination ("I'm cringing at this answer")

## Ideological Patterns

### Core Convictions
1. **Alliance/understanding is everything** - backed by research (largest factor in therapeutic outcomes)
2. **People have their own answers** - Carl Rogers influence
3. **Therapy provides space, not solutions** - person-centered philosophy
4. **Connection over technique** - moving away from prescriptive ACT toward relational/psychodynamic
5. **Speaking the same language** - operationalizing what client's words mean to THEM

### Values Hierarchy
1. Understanding/connection (top priority)
2. Client as expert in their own life
3. Curiosity and exploration
4. Authenticity and honesty
5. Research-backed approaches (alliance, relational)

### What He's Against (But Respectfully)
- Manualized CBT ("boring," "condescending," "not what I signed up for")
- Being the expert/telling people what to do
- Homework assignments ("didn't sign up to be a school teacher")
- Prescriptive, technique-heavy approaches
- BUT acknowledges these can be helpful, just not his approach

### The Core Tension (Ideological)
- Aspiration vs. Current Reality: Can articulate vision but doesn't believe he's delivering it
- Expert vs. Broken: "I don't want to be the expert, but at the same time, I don't want to be the broken one who doubts himself either"
- Authenticity vs. Marketing: Wants to be real but concerned about what clients want to hear
- Theory vs. Practice: Can explain ACT/person-centered intellectually but unsure if he's actually doing it

---

## Recurring Themes Across Q1-Q7

1. **Gap between aspiration and delivery** - appears in Q2, Q6, Q7
2. **Intellectualization awareness** - recognizes when he's explaining theory vs. lived experience
3. **Relatability as differentiator** - "I'm like them" (Q5, Q6, Q7)
4. **Honesty about not knowing** - appears in almost every answer
5. **References to authorities he admires** - Shedler, Foster, Rogers (but after expressing his own thoughts)
6. **Speaks as a client himself** - "If I don't feel understood, none of it matters" (Q7)
