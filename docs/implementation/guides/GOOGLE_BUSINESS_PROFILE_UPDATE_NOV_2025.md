# Google Business Profile (GBP) Optimization Guide
**Date:** November 18, 2025
**Goal:** Align GBP signals with new website SEO to capture "Near Me" traffic.

Since you are a Service Area Business (SAB) without a public address, your GBP settings are critical for showing up in local searches like "Therapist Burlington".

## 1. Service Areas (Critical)
**Action:** Go to "Edit Profile" > "Location" > "Service areas".
**Update:** Ensure ONLY these cities are listed (remove broad "Ontario" if possible, focus on key cities for density):
*   Burlington, ON
*   Oakville, ON
*   Hamilton, ON
*   Mississauga, ON
*   Toronto, ON
*   Ottawa, ON

*Why?* Google ranks you better when you are specific. "Ontario" is too broad for local map packs.

## 2. Add "Products" (High Visibility)
**Action:** Go to "Edit Products" > "Add Product".
**Create Product:** "Anxiety & Stress Therapy"
*   **Category:** Psychotherapy
*   **Price:** $175.00
*   **Description:** Evidence-based virtual therapy for high-functioning professionals managing anxiety, burnout, and workplace stress. CRPO Registered. No waitlist.
*   **Button:** "Book Online" -> Link to `https://nextsteptherapy.janeapp.com/`

*Why?* Products appear visually on your profile and take up screen real estate, pushing competitors down.

## 3. Update "Services"
**Action:** Go to "Edit Services".
**Add/Select:**
*   Psychotherapy
*   Mental health service
*   Anxiety disorder treatment
*   Depression treatment
*   Virtual therapy (if available as custom service)

## 4. Business Attributes
**Action:** Go to "Edit Profile" > "More".
**Check these boxes:**
*   **Accessibility:** Wheelchair accessible (leave blank if virtual only, or "N/A"), generally for SABs this is hidden.
*   **Amenities:** LGBTQ+ friendly, Transgender safe space (Crucial for trust signals).
*   **Service Options:** Online care (Check "Yes"), Onsite services (Check "No").
