## 1. Executive Summary & Decision

### The Situation
- I operate "Next Step Therapy" as a sole proprietorship (registered Nov 25, 2024)
- A different entity "Next Step Therapy Clinic Inc." incorporated Dec 19, 2024
- They filed trademark application #2385915 on March 13, 2025
- Application status: "Formalized, awaiting examination" (not yet reviewed)

### The Decision
**Wait, continue testing, rebrand when ready to commit to scaling.**

This is NOT a defensive retreat. The current name is a "test environment" for building:
- SEO skills
- Client acquisition systems
- Content frameworks
- Operational workflows

When ready to commit (scale practice, buy clinic, or launch platform model), rebrand as the **launch moment** with an intentional brand.

### Why This Approach
1. **2+ years runway** - CIPO backlog means application won't be examined until late 2027/2028
2. **Low current investment** - 3 reviews, 178 clicks, ~20 clients, ~$2-3K/month
3. **Low emotional attachment** - Rated 3/10
4. **Negotiation is a trap** - Coexistence agreements would limit future options (e.g., opening physical clinics)
5. **Opposition is irrational** - $25K-100K to protect a name I don't care about

## 2. Timeline of Events

| Date | Event | Party |
|------|-------|-------|
| October 29, 2024 | Domain nextsteptherapy.ca registered | Me |
| November 25, 2024 | Sole proprietorship "NEXT STEP THERAPY" registered (BIN: 1001072925) | Me |
| December 19, 2024 | Corporation "NEXT STEP THERAPY CLINIC INC." incorporated (OCN: 1001095926) | Them |
| January 7, 2025 | First paying client | Me |
| March 13, 2025 | Trademark application #2385915 filed | Them |
| December 22, 2025 | Deep research conducted, decision made | Me |
| ~Late 2027/2028 | Estimated examination date (CIPO backlog) | CIPO |

**Critical gap:** December 19, 2024 - January 7, 2025 (19 days)
- If they saw clients before January 7, they could claim prior commercial use
- This "black box" period is a litigation risk if opposing

---

## 3. Key Legal Findings

### Both Reports Agree On:

**Prior Use Rights**
- My January 7, 2025 first client date establishes "use in association with services" under Section 4(2) of the Trademarks Act
- This predates their March 13, 2025 filing by 2+ months
- Domain registration (Oct 29) and business name registration (Nov 25) do NOT count as trademark use - only actual commercial activity matters

**Confusion Analysis**
- Adding "Clinic" to an identical mark does not create sufficient distinction
- The core distinctive element "NEXT STEP THERAPY" is identical
- Confusion finding would be almost guaranteed if opposed

**Mark Weakness**
- "Next Step" is a weak/descriptive mark in therapy/healthcare
- Even if I win opposition, protection scope is narrow
- Would face endless "Next Step [X]" conflicts

**Opposition Economics**
- Filing fee: ~$1,085
- Realistic total cost: $25,000 - $100,000+
- Timeline: 2.5 - 4 years to decision
- Self-representation: Technically allowed but practically challenging

**The "Black Box" Risk**
- If they were commercially operating before January 7, 2025, my prior use claim evaporates
- They're a physical clinic with multiple therapists - plausible they operated in December
- This is a major litigation risk

---

## 4. Strategic Decision & Rationale

### The "Test Environment" Framework

Current practice is not "the brand" - it's a sandbox for learning:
- SEO experimentation
- Client acquisition testing
- Content system building
- Operational workflow development

The name is incidental to the learning. When ready to commit to scaling, rebrand as part of the launch moment.

### Why NOT Negotiate

Coexistence agreements would require:
- Defining service boundaries (virtual vs. in-person)
- Potentially limiting geographic expansion
- Trading future flexibility for a name rated 3/10

**Risk identified:** What if I want to open a physical Toronto clinic in 3 years? A coexistence agreement would block that.

### Why NOT Oppose

- Cost ($25K-100K) vs. value of name (low)
- 2-4 year timeline of uncertainty
- "Black box" risk could lose immediately
- Would be defending a weak mark forever

### Why NOT Rebrand Now

- No immediate pressure (2+ years until examination)
- Current investment is low enough to switch later
- Still in learning/testing phase
- Rebrand as launch moment is strategically cleaner

### Thresholds to Monitor

When these numbers get "sticky," make the rebrand decision:

| Metric | Current | Getting Sticky | Probably Too Late |
|--------|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Google Reviews | 3 | 15+ | 50+ |
| Monthly Clicks | ~60 | 300+ | 1,000+ |
| Monthly Revenue | ~$2-3K | $8K+ | $15K+ |
| Quality Backlinks | 0 | 5+ | 20+ |
| Total Clients | ~20 | 75+ | 200+ |

### Strategic Legal Analysis: Trademark Conflict and Brand Viability Report

Prepared For: Sole Proprietor, "Next Step Therapy"
Subject: Comprehensive Analysis of Trademark Application #2385915, Prior Use Rights, and Strategic Options
Date: December 22, 2025

#### 1. Executive Summary

##### 1.1 The Strategic Imperative

You stand at a critical juncture in the lifecycle of your nascent psychotherapy practice. While you have successfully launched operations and secured your first paying client as of January 7, 2025, the simultaneous emergence of a corporate competitor—"Next Step Therapy Clinic Inc."—and their subsequent trademark filing creates a direct threat to your brand identity. The central tension in your scenario is not merely legal but economic: you possess a potentially superior legal claim to the trade name "Next Step Therapy" based on the Canadian doctrine of "prior use," yet the cost of enforcing this right through the Trademarks Opposition Board (TMOB) is disproportionate to the current commercial value of the asset.

The analysis detailed in this report confirms that Canadian trademark law protects the first person to use a mark, not necessarily the first to file. Your registration of the sole proprietorship in November 2024 and your commercial use in January 2025 likely predate the opponent's filing date of March 13, 2025. Under Section 16 of the Trademarks Act, this gives you grounds to oppose their registration. However, the legal reality is nuanced by the "black box" period between their incorporation in December 2024 and your first client in January 2025. If the opponent engaged in any commercial activity during that three-week window, your priority claim evaporates, leaving you exposed to significant legal costs with no return.

##### 1.2 The "Pivot and Preserve" Recommendation

After an exhaustive review of the statutory framework, procedural costs, and market dynamics, the recommendation of this report is to **rebrand immediately**. This is the "Pivot and Preserve" strategy.

While you likely hold the legal high ground regarding "entitlement" to the name, the "Next Step" brand is legally weak, functionally descriptive, and heavily saturated in the healthcare sector. Fighting a multi-year opposition battle against an incorporated entity with physical premises to protect a name you rate "3/10" in emotional attachment is economically irrational. The projected cost of a proper legal defense ($15,000–$40,000 over 3 years) vastly exceeds the cost of a high-quality rebrand ($500–$2,000) and the "SEO equity" you would lose by switching domains after only three months.

This report serves as a comprehensive due diligence document. It will first dissect the legal physics of your situation to ensure you understand exactly why you have a claim, then pivot to the procedural and economic realities that make abandoning that claim the smarter business move. It concludes with a tactical guide on how to execute a rebrand without losing your current client base or search ranking.

#### 2. Legal Framework: The Physics of Canadian Trademark Law

To understand your position, one must first dismantle the common misconceptions regarding business registration versus trademark rights. The Canadian system is idiosyncratic, relying heavily on "common law" principles codified in the Trademarks Act.

##### 2.1 The Doctrine of "Use" vs. Registration

In many jurisdictions, the trademark register is the final authority. In Canada, it is a record of rights that are created through use. Section 4 of the Trademarks Act provides the statutory definition that governs your dispute.

###### 2.1.1 Deemed Use in Services (Section 4(2))

For a service-based business like psychotherapy, "use" is defined specifically in Section 4(2):

> "A trademark is deemed to be used in association with services if it is used or displayed in the performance or advertising of those services."

This definition creates a two-part test that courts have rigorously interpreted:

- **Display:** The mark must be visible to the consumer. This includes your website header, the invoice sent to a client, your email signature, or a sign on a wall.
- **Performance or Advertising:** The display must occur in the performance of the service or the advertising of it. Crucially, strictly "advertising" is only considered use if the services are arguably available to be performed in Canada at the same time.

**Application to Your Timeline:**

- **October 29, 2024 (Domain Registration):** You registered nextsteptherapy.ca. In the eyes of the law, this is merely a preparatory act. It is akin to signing a lease for a storefront but keeping the paper in your drawer. It does not constitute "use" because no service was available or performed.
- **November 25, 2024 (Sole Proprietorship):** You registered the Master Business License. This is a regulatory requirement to operate under a name other than your own. It grants no trademark rights. It essentially tells the government "I am doing business as X," but it does not tell the marketplace "This brand distinguishes my services."
- **January 7, 2025 (First Client):** This is your "Golden Date." The moment you conducted a therapy session and billed a client under the name "Next Step Therapy," you satisfied the requirements of Section 4(2). You displayed the mark in the performance of the service. This is the date your trademark rights were born.

###### 2.1.2 The "Token Use" Trap

Courts distinguish between "bona fide" commercial use and "token use" designed merely to reserve a name. Your revenue of ~$2,000–$3,000/month indicates bona fide commercial activity. You are not a squatter; you are a market participant. This strengthens your position significantly compared to someone who merely set up a website but never took a client.

##### 2.2 Entitlement and Priority (Section 16)

The engine of a trademark opposition is Section 16 of the Act. This section determines who is "entitled" to register a mark. It operates on a timeline comparison.

**The Rule:**

An applicant (the Opponent) is entitled to register the trademark "NEXT STEP THERAPY CLINIC" unless, at the date they filed their application (or the date they first used it), the mark was confusing with:
- A trademark previously used in Canada by another person (Section 16(1)(a)); OR
- A trade name previously used in Canada by another person (Section 16(1)(c)).

**The Analysis:**

- Your Priority Date: January 7, 2025 (at the latest).
- Opponent's Filing Date: March 13, 2025.

If the opponent filed their application based on "Proposed Use" (meaning they intend to use it but haven't started), the material date for the conflict is their filing date: March 13, 2025.

Since you were using the mark before March 13, 2025, you have priority. Under Section 16(1), they are not entitled to registration because, on the day they approached the Trademark Office, the mark was already confusing with your existing business.

**The "Black Box" Risk:**

The critical vulnerability in your position is the opponent's activity between December 19, 2024 (their incorporation) and January 7, 2025 (your first client).

If the opponent incorporated and immediately:
- Put up a sign at 7 Saint Thomas Street;
- Sent out flyers;
- Opened their booking portal; or
- Saw a single client;

Then their date of first use would be December 2024. In that scenario, they have priority over you. Because they are a physical clinic with "multiple therapists," it is highly plausible they were operational immediately upon incorporation or shortly thereafter. This 19-day gap is a massive litigation risk. If you oppose, and they produce an invoice dated January 2, 2025, you lose the case immediately after spending thousands of dollars.

##### 2.3 The Test of Confusion (Section 6)

Even if you establish priority, you must prove "confusion." You must demonstrate that the average consumer, encountering "Next Step Therapy Clinic," would assume it is the same business as "Next Step Therapy."

The Supreme Court of Canada provided the definitive test in *Masterpiece Inc. v. Alavida Lifestyles Inc.*. This case is strikingly similar to yours: it involved a retirement home dispute where the brand names were similar, but the locations were different.

**Key Principles from Masterpiece:**

- **Consumer Perspective:** The court looks at the "casual consumer somewhat in a hurry." This person does not carefully analyze the corporate registry; they rely on general impressions.
- **Location Irrelevance:** The opponent is in Toronto; you are virtual/Ontario-wide. The Court held that for a federal registration, the analysis must assume both parties are operating in the same location. A registration gives the owner the right to use the mark anywhere in Canada. Therefore, the Trademarks Office will assume the Clinic opens a branch right next to your virtual "office."
- **Resemblance:** The degree of resemblance is the dominant factor.
  - Your Mark: NEXT STEP THERAPY
  - Their Mark: NEXT STEP THERAPY CLINIC
  - The word "CLINIC" is descriptive. It adds no distinctiveness. The word "THERAPY" is generic. The only distinctive element in both marks is "NEXT STEP." Because the dominant components are identical, a finding of confusion is almost guaranteed.

**Conclusion on Liability:**

If the timeline favors you (i.e., they didn't operate in December), the law dictates that you should win an opposition. The marks are confusing, and you were there first. However, legal right does not equal economic sense.

#### 3. The Opposition Process: A Cost and Procedure Analysis

You requested a "realistic total cost" and timeline. The following analysis breaks down the opposition procedure into its constituent phases, applying 2025 fee structures and typical legal billing rates.

##### 3.1 The Procedural Timeline

An opposition is a lawsuit conducted by correspondence. It is slow, rigid, and bureaucratic.

| Phase | Duration | Activity | Action Required |
|-------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Advertisement | Month 0 | App published in Journal | Monitor CIPO database |
| Filing Opposition | Month 0-2 | Strict 2-month window | File Statement of Opposition (Form 2). Pay fee. |
| Counter Statement | Month 3-5 | Applicant replies | Opponent files defense (Form 3) |
| Evidence (You) | Month 6-10 | 4 months to file | Submit affidavits of use (invoices, hits) |
| Evidence (Them) | Month 11-15 | 4 months to file | Applicant submits their evidence |
| Cross-Examination | Month 16-20 | Varies | Lawyers question affiants on record |
| Written Arguments | Month 21-24 | Legal briefing | File 20-30 page legal factums |
| Oral Hearing | Month 25-30 | Optional | Argue before a Hearing Officer |
| Decision | Month 36+ | Waiting | Registrar issues final ruling |

**Total Duration:** Expect 2.5 to 4 years from filing to decision.

##### 3.2 The Financial Burden

While the government filing fee is ~$1,085, this is the "tip of the iceberg." The bulk of the cost is legal fees. Trademark opposition is a specialized field; general practitioners rarely handle it, and specialists charge $400–$800/hour.

**Detailed Cost Breakdown (Conservative Estimates):**

| Item | Estimated Cost (CAD) | Notes |
|------|---------------------|-------|
| Gov. Filing Fee | $1,085 | Mandatory CIPO fee |
| Statement Drafting | $2,500 - $4,000 | Strategic drafting of grounds (s.16, s.30, s.12) |
| Reviewing Counter | $1,000 | Analyzing their defense strategy |
| Your Evidence | $4,000 - $8,000 | Preparing affidavits. Compiling exhibits. |
| Reviewing Their Ev. | $2,000 - $4,000 | Analyzing their "black box" evidence from Dec 2024 |
| Cross-Examination | $5,000 - $10,000 | Transcript fees ($1,500), Attendance fees, Prep time |
| Written Arguments | $5,000 - $8,000 | Drafting the legal brief (Factum) |
| Oral Hearing | $5,000 - $8,000 | Prep and attendance at the hearing |
| **TOTAL** | **$25,585 - $44,085** | Excludes appeals to Federal Court |

**Can you self-represent?**

Technically, yes. The Act allows it. However, the TMOB has strict rules of evidence. If you file an affidavit that contains hearsay, or fails to properly exhibit documents, or if you miss a deadline by 24 hours, your case can be struck. The success rate for self-represented opponents against represented applicants is historically very low. Given the opponent is an incorporated clinic, they will likely hire counsel. You would be bringing a knife to a gunfight.

##### 3.3 The New Risks: Cost Awards (2025)

As of 2025, the TMOB has new powers to award costs. Previously, each side bore their own costs. Now, the Registrar can order the losing party to pay a portion of the winner's costs if there was "unreasonable conduct" or under standard tariff tables.

**Risk:** If you oppose and lose (e.g., because they prove they used it in Dec 2024), and the Registrar finds your opposition was meritless or you dragged out the process, you could be ordered to pay $2,000–$5,000 to the opponent.

##### 3.4 The "Success Rate" Variable

Statistics on "prior use" oppositions favor the party with the earliest clear documentation.

- If they claim "Proposed Use" (no use before filing), your invoice from Jan 7 makes your success probability **High (70-80%)**.
- If they claim "Use since Dec 2024," your success probability drops to **Low (<20%)**.

**The Gamble:** You won't know their evidence until Month 11 of the process—after you have already spent ~$8,000 in fees.

#### 4. Situational Analysis: The Opponent and the Market

##### 4.1 The Opponent: "Next Step Therapy Clinic Inc."

Profiling the opponent is crucial for strategy:

- **Scale:** They are a group practice. Psychology Today lists multiple practitioners (Dr. Tilda Yeow, Hani Osman, etc.). This implies a revenue stream significantly higher than a sole proprietorship. They have "overhead" and likely a legal budget line item.
- **Location:** 7 Saint Thomas Street, Toronto. This is Yorkville—one of the most expensive real estate corridors in Canada. An entity paying rent in Yorkville is not a hobby business. They are capitalized.
- **Motivation:** They filed the trademark. This indicates they value the brand enough to pay for protection. They are unlikely to simply walk away if you send a letter.

##### 4.2 The "Weak Mark" Theory

In trademark law, not all names are created equal.

- **Strong Marks:** Arbitrary words (e.g., "Apple" for computers, "Kodak" for cameras).
- **Weak Marks:** Words that describe the service or are commonly used phrases.

"Next Step" is a weak mark in the therapy/rehab space. It is a common metaphor for recovery. A search of the CIPO database likely reveals dozens of "Next Step" marks in various classes.

**Implication:** Even if you win the opposition, you win a "narrow" scope of protection. You might stop this clinic, but you can't stop "Next Step Rehab," "Next Step Coaching," or "Next Step Recovery." You will be playing "Whack-A-Mole" forever. The brand does not have high inherent distinctiveness, meaning its value as an asset is capped.

##### 4.3 Digital Footprint Analysis

- **Your Traffic:** 178 clicks/3 months. This is a respectable start for a new solo practice, but it is not "entrenched."
- **Backlinks:** None. This is critical. You have no "domain authority" to lose.
- **Reviews:** 3 Google reviews. These are portable (you can rename the GBP).

**Conclusion:** You are essentially a startup. You do not yet have the "golden handcuffs" of a massive brand following that would force you to fight. You are agile enough to pivot.

#### 5. The "Do Nothing" Option: Risk Assessment

What happens if you ignore the trademark application?

##### 5.1 Registration = Exclusive Rights (Section 19)

If they register the mark, Section 19 gives them the exclusive right to use it throughout Canada. This flips the burden of proof.

- Currently: They have to prove they are entitled.
- Post-Registration: You have to prove why you shouldn't be sued.

##### 5.2 The Infringement Threat

Once registered, they can send a Cease & Desist letter demanding you stop using "Next Step Therapy." If you refuse, they can sue you in Federal Court for trademark infringement.

**Your Defense:** You would plead "Section 21" (Concurrent Use) or "Prior Use". You would argue, "I was here first."

**The Problem:** Defending a Federal Court lawsuit costs $50,000+ easily. Even if you win the right to keep your name in your local area, the legal fees would bankrupt a part-time practice.

##### 5.3 The "Passing Off" Risk

Even without a registration, if they operate a physical clinic and clients start going to them thinking it's you (or vice versa), they could sue you for "passing off" (Section 7(b)). Given they are larger, they could argue they have established "reputation" faster than you.

**The Verdict on Doing Nothing:** It is the highest-risk option. It leaves your business operating under a Sword of Damocles. You could receive a lawsuit notice in 2 years when your practice is earning $100k/year, forcing a rebrand when it hurts much more than it does now.

#### 6. The Rebranding Option: The Strategic Pivot

This is the core recommendation. We will now treat this not as a legal defeat, but as a strategic business upgrade.

##### 6.1 Why Rebrand? The Economic Argument

- Cost of Fight: ~$30,000 (Legal) + Stress + Risk of Loss.
- Cost of Switch: ~$500 (Admin) + 20 hours (Labor).
- Asset Value: "Next Step" is a 3/10 name. "Veridian" (or similar) could be a 9/10 name.

##### 6.2 The Execution Playbook (Step-by-Step)

To mitigate the "hassle," follow this checklist:

**Phase 1: Selection (Weeks 1-2)**

- **Brainstorming:** Move away from descriptive terms ("Healing," "Hope," "Step"). Look for "Suggestive" or "Arbitrary" terms.
- **Examples:** "Aetheria Therapy," "North Node Psychology," "Blue Spruce Counselling."
- **Clearance:** Before buying anything, search the CIPO Database yourself. Look for exact matches. Then search Google for "Name + Therapy Canada."
- **Domain:** Check .ca availability.

**Phase 2: Registration (Week 3)**

- **Sole Prop:** Register the new name with Ontario Business Registry (~$60). You can keep your existing BIN and just "add" a name or register a new one.
- **Domain:** Buy the new URL.

**Phase 3: The Digital Migration (Week 4) - Critical for SEO**

You expressed concern about your 178 clicks. Here is how you keep them:

**301 Redirects:** This is the most important technical step. Set up a "permanent 301 redirect" from nextsteptherapy.ca to newname.ca.
- **Result:** Anyone clicking your old links (or finding you on Google) is instantly transported to your new site. Google transfers ~95% of the "ranking power" to the new domain.

**Google Business Profile (GBP):** Distinct from your website. Log in to Google. Change the name from "Next Step Therapy" to "New Name."
- **Note:** Do not create a new profile. Renaming keeps your 3 reviews and your verification history.

**Jane App:** Update your booking portal URL and logo. Jane App supports redirects or alias URLs easily.

**Phase 4: Communication (Week 5)**

- **Clients:** Email your 20 clients.
- **Script:** "We are growing! To better reflect our expanding services, Next Step Therapy is becoming [New Name]. The same therapist, same care, just a new look."
- **Psychology Today:** Update your profile. This is often a major traffic driver.

##### 6.3 Is Rebranding "Abandonment"?

Yes, and that is the point. By rebranding, you are voluntarily abandoning the "Next Step" mark. You lose the rights to it.

**Strategic Advantage:** You step out of the path of the "Next Step Therapy Clinic Inc." steamroller. They get the name. You get a business that is legally secure.

#### 7. Alternative Strategies (Option C)

Are there middle-ground options?

##### 7.1 The Coexistence Agreement

You could hire a lawyer to write to them: "I have prior use. I will agree not to oppose your mark if you sign an agreement saying you will never sue me for using 'Next Step Therapy'."

- **Pros:** Keeps the name. Avoids opposition costs.
- **Cons:** Legal fees to draft/negotiate ($2,000–$5,000). They might refuse. It restricts your future growth (e.g., they might ban you from opening a physical clinic).
- **Feasibility:** Low. They have the upper hand financially. They have little incentive to sign.

##### 7.2 The "Wait and See" (Section 21 Claim)

You could ignore the opposition, let them register, and if they sue you, claim the "Good Faith Prior Use" exception under Section 21 of the Act.

- **Mechanism:** A court can permit you to keep using the name in a "defined territorial area" (e.g., just your current city).
- **Risk:** This requires being sued first. It is a defense, not a shield. It also freezes your business geographically. You could never expand beyond your current area.

##### 7.3 Filing Your Own Trademark

You could file your own application for "Next Step Therapy" right now.

- **Result:** The Trademarks Office would eventually see both applications. They would likely issue a "confusion objection" against both of you, forcing you into opposition anyway. It adds cost (~$1,500) without solving the core problem.

#### 8. Similar Cases and Precedents

##### 8.1 Masterpiece Inc. v. Alavida Lifestyles Inc. (2011 SCC 27)

This is the seminal case for your situation.

- **Facts:** A small operator in Alberta ("Masterpiece") used the name first. A developer ("Alavida") applied for "Masterpiece Living" and operated in Ontario.
- **Outcome:** The Supreme Court ruled for the small operator. They cancelled Alavida's registration.
- **Lesson:** The "little guy" can win. Prior use is supreme.

**Why it doesn't change my recommendation:** Masterpiece Inc. had to fight all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada. The legal fees likely exceeded $200,000. They won on principle, but the cost was astronomical. Unless you have a war chest, the legal victory is a financial disaster.

##### 8.2 Cineplex Odeon Corp. v. Drabinsky (2001)

- **Facts:** Two entertainment moguls fought over a trademark. One claimed "use" based on advertising and press releases before the service opened.
- **Outcome:** The court ruled that advertising without the ability to perform the service is not use.
- **Lesson:** This confirms your "use" date is likely Jan 7 (when you could perform therapy), not Oct 29 (domain reg). This narrows the gap with the opponent, making your position more precarious if they opened in Dec 2024.

#### 9. Final Recommendations and Roadmap

##### 9.1 Summary of Options

| Option | Cost (Est.) | Time | Risk | Brand Future |
|--------|-------------|------|------|--------------|
| A: Oppose | $25k - $40k | 2-4 Years | High (Loss of $) | Weak ("Next Step" is saturated) |
| B: Rebrand | $1k - $2k | 1 Month | Low | Strong (Unique, ownable asset) |
| C: Do Nothing | $0 (Now) / $50k+ (Later) | Indefinite | Extreme (Lawsuit) | Zero (Likely forced rebrand later) |

##### 9.2 The Decision Framework

You asked for a rational economic choice.

- Value of the Name: Low. "Next Step" is generic.
- Cost of Defense: High ($25k+).
- Cost of Replacement: Low ($1k).
- Equation: Value < Cost.

**Recommendation: Option B (Rebrand).**

##### 9.3 Immediate Next Steps (The "To-Do" List)

1. **Stop Spending on "Next Step":** Do not print new business cards. Do not pay for Google Ads on this keyword.
2. **Start the Pivot:** Spend this weekend brainstorming 5 new names. Use the "CIPO Trademarks Database" (online, free) to check them.
3. **Secure the Asset:** Once you find a clear name, register the domain and the Sole Proprietorship immediately.
4. **Execute the 301 Redirect:** As soon as the new site is ready.
5. **Optional Courtesy Letter:** Once you have rebranded (and only then), you could send a polite email to the Clinic: "I noticed your application. I have prior rights, but I have decided to rebrand to 'Veridian Therapy' to avoid confusion. Good luck with your clinic."

**Why do this?** It creates a paper trail of your "good faith" cooperation, which protects you if they ever try to sue you for the 3 months you used the name. It effectively closes the file.

##### 9.4 A Note on "Sunk Costs"

You mentioned you are a pragmatist. The hardest part of this advice is accepting that the work you put in since October feels "wasted." It is not.

You built the structure of a business (Jane App, CRPO protocols, workflow).
You acquired clients (who follow you, not the logo).
You learned SEO skills.

None of this is lost. You are simply painting the house a different color. The foundation remains.

By rebranding now, you are trading a "3/10" name with a "10/10" legal problem for a "8/10" name with "0/10" legal problems. That is the definition of a rational economic choice.

### Trademark Opposition Analysis: The Pragmatic Path Forward

**The economically rational choice is not to oppose.** Given a 3/10 emotional attachment, modest revenue ($2-3K/month), and opposition costs that could consume 1-4 years of business income, the math strongly favors either strategic patience or proactive rebranding. However, the sole proprietor holds meaningful prior use rights that provide leverage for negotiation and ongoing legal protection.

#### The legal picture is clearer than expected

The sole proprietor has **established prior use rights** under Canadian law. The first paying client on January 7, 2025 constitutes "use in association with services" under Section 4(2) of the Trademarks Act—and this predates the trademark application filing on March 13, 2025 by over two months. Crucially, business name registration and domain registration **do not count as trademark use**. Only actual commercial activity—seeing clients, advertising services, displaying the mark while performing services—establishes rights.

Under Section 16(1)(c), an applicant is not entitled to registration if the mark was confusing with "a trade name that had been previously used in Canada." The sole proprietor's January 7 first client date establishes prior use before the March 13 filing date—a strong legal position. However, one critical unknown remains: **when did the corporation begin seeing clients?** If they were commercially operating before January 7, 2025, despite incorporating later, they might claim earlier use.

The confusion analysis strongly favors the sole proprietor. Canadian courts have consistently held that adding descriptive terms like "Clinic" to an otherwise identical mark does not create sufficient distinction. In *Canada Bread v. Dr. Smood*, the Federal Court warned that "merely adding modest design elements and/or descriptive words to an otherwise confusing mark may not suffice." The Supreme Court's *Masterpiece* decision further established that the degree of resemblance—here, sharing the identical distinctive element "NEXT STEP THERAPY"—is often the most important confusion factor.

#### Opposition economics don't favor small practitioners

The filing fee of **$1,085** is just the entrance ticket. Realistic total costs paint a different picture:

| Scenario | Estimated Cost Range |
|----------|---------------------|
| Applicant doesn't respond (deemed abandonment) | $3,000-8,000 |
| Evidence filed but settlement reached | $15,000-40,000 |
| Fully contested to decision | $50,000-100,000+ |
| With Federal Court appeal | $100,000-200,000+ |

Self-representation is legally permitted but practically challenging. Opposition proceedings require sworn affidavits, potential cross-examinations under oath, written legal arguments citing case precedents, and strict procedural deadlines. Missing a deadline results in deemed withdrawal. CIPO explicitly states these proceedings are "complex and cost much time and money" and "urges" parties to hire trademark agents.

The timeline offers breathing room. The application is currently "awaiting examination," meaning **22-39+ months** before it even gets reviewed, potentially refused, and published for opposition. CIPO has a backlog of ~155,000 applications. The sole proprietor need not decide immediately—the trademark may be refused during examination without any opposition required.

If opposition proceeds, expect **2-4 years** for a contested proceeding. Of 1,160 oppositions filed annually, only 111 decisions are rendered—most settle before decision.

#### The financial risk of losing is manageable but real

Under new rules effective April 2025, **costs are not automatically awarded** to the winning party. The sole proprietor wouldn't face a large adverse cost award simply for losing. Cost awards are reserved for exceptional circumstances: bad faith, frivolous conduct, or causing undue delay. The primary risk is losing the non-refundable filing fee plus any legal costs incurred.

However, there's no protection against the other side pursuing enforcement after they register. A cease-and-desist letter could arrive, and defending against trademark infringement in Federal Court costs **$20,000-100,000+**.

#### Four strategic paths analyzed

**Path 1: Wait and Monitor (Recommended First Step)**

Do nothing until the application is actually examined and advertised. The trademark may be refused during examination—no opposition needed. This costs nothing and preserves all options. Set a calendar reminder to check the application status quarterly via CIPO's trademark database.

**Path 2: Attempt Negotiation Before Opposition**

If the application proceeds toward publication, initiate direct contact with the corporation. The sole proprietor has leverage: documented prior use that could ground an opposition. A coexistence agreement could allow both marks with defined boundaries—the sole proprietor's virtual province-wide practice versus the corporation's in-person Toronto clinic.

Potential negotiation terms include: mutual non-opposition commitments, service channel differentiation (virtual vs. in-person), distinct branding elements, and non-interference clauses. Cost: $0-5,000 depending on lawyer involvement. Note: Canadian law (*Masterpiece*) holds that geographic separation doesn't affect confusion analysis—both parties using marks "in Ontario" is assumed—but practical market separation can be contractually defined.

**Path 3: Proactive Rebranding**

Given 3/10 emotional attachment, this eliminates all uncertainty at modest cost:

| Item | Cost Range |
|------|-----------|
| New domain | $15-100 |
| Logo/branding | $100-2,000 |
| Website updates | $500-3,000 |
| Ontario business name registration | $60 |
| Google Business Profile update | Free |
| **Total** | **$675-5,160** |

The strategic question: **rebrand now or wait?** Waiting preserves options and costs nothing. Rebranding now eliminates any future legal exposure but forfeits negotiation leverage. The rational approach is to wait until the application progresses toward advertisement, then decide.

Rebranding does not immediately forfeit prior use rights, but prolonged non-use (3+ years) can constitute abandonment. If rebranding, the sole proprietor should formally document the prior use evidence now—in case it's ever needed for a defense.

**Path 4: Formal Opposition**

Only makes economic sense if: (a) the name has significant goodwill worth protecting, (b) the sole proprietor is committed to fighting, or (c) the opposition serves as leverage for a better negotiated outcome. For a practice with ~20 clients, 3 reviews, and low emotional attachment, this is hard to justify.

#### Evidence documentation: Do this regardless of strategy

Whether opposing, negotiating, or doing nothing, the sole proprietor should compile and preserve evidence of prior use **now**:

- **Affidavit or statutory declaration** from the sole proprietor attesting to use timeline
- **First client documentation**: invoice, receipt, appointment record dated January 7, 2025
- **Website archive**: Use archive.org Wayback Machine to capture nextsteptherapy.ca showing services
- **Google Business Profile screenshots** with review dates
- **Any marketing materials**: social media posts, directory listings, business cards
- **Domain registration records** (WHOIS showing October 29, 2024)
- **Ontario business registration certificate** (November 25, 2024)

This evidence establishes prior use and supports either: opposition, negotiation leverage, or defense against future infringement claims. Cost: essentially free if done personally.

#### Risk assessment by scenario

**Scenario A: Do nothing, they get trademark, take no action against you**

Outcome: You continue operating, they ignore you. This is plausible—enforcing trademarks costs money, and a small virtual practice may not be worth pursuing.

**Scenario B: Do nothing, they get trademark, send cease-and-desist**

Outcome: You'd need to either rebrand or mount a legal defense citing prior use under Section 21 (concurrent use rights). Defense costs: $10,000-50,000. Your prior use provides a legitimate defense but doesn't guarantee victory.

**Scenario C: Rebrand proactively**

Outcome: No legal risk. Clean break. Cost: $675-5,160. Opportunity to choose a more distinctive name.

**Scenario D: Oppose and win**

Outcome: Their application refused. You continue using the name. Cost: $5,000-100,000+ depending on whether contested.

**Scenario E: Oppose and lose**

Outcome: Their trademark registers anyway. You've spent $5,000-100,000. You may still have prior use rights as a defense, but weaker position.

#### The decision framework

For this specific situation—low attachment (3/10), modest revenue ($24-36K/year), sole proprietor resources—the economically rational decision tree is:

1. **Immediately**: Document all evidence of prior use (free, 2-3 hours)
2. **Now through 2027**: Monitor application status quarterly; do nothing else
3. **If application proceeds to advertisement**: Evaluate whether to negotiate or rebrand
4. **If negotiation is viable**: Attempt coexistence agreement ($0-5,000)
5. **If negotiation fails**: Rebrand ($675-5,160) rather than oppose ($15,000-100,000)

**Opposition makes sense only if:**
- Emotional attachment rises substantially (to 7+/10)
- Revenue grows significantly (to $10K+/month) where brand equity matters
- The sole proprietor is willing to spend $20,000+ to defend the name
- A lawyer offers a flat-fee opposition with clear scope

#### The honest bottom line

The sole proprietor has a legitimate legal claim but pursuing it would be economically irrational given current circumstances. Opposition could cost **50-300% of annual business revenue** with no guaranteed outcome. The smarter play is to preserve options, document evidence, wait for the application to progress, and then either negotiate from a position of documented strength or rebrand cleanly.

The other entity filing a trademark application doesn't immediately threaten the sole proprietor's ability to operate. The application will take 2+ years to process. Even if granted, prior use provides some ongoing protection. And trademark enforcement requires the holder to spend money pursuing you—a small virtual practice may simply not be worth their trouble.

If the sole proprietor truly has only 3/10 attachment to the name, the rational answer is clear: **don't spend $15,000-100,000 defending something you don't care much about when $3,000-5,000 solves the problem permanently through rebranding.** Use the waiting period to gradually build presence under a new, more distinctive name—one that won't face competition from any "X Clinic" variants.

## 9. CIPO Communication Record

### Original Email Sent (December 2025)

**To:** Canadian Intellectual Property Office
**Subject:** Notice of Prior Registration – Trademark Application No. 2385915

---

Dear Canadian Intellectual Property Office,

Re: Trademark Application No. 2385915 – "NEXT STEP THERAPY CLINIC & DESIGN"

I am writing to inform CIPO that I registered and incorporated the business name "NEXT STEP THERAPY CLINIC INC." prior to the filing date of the above-referenced trademark application.

**My Prior Registrations:**
- Sole Proprietorship: "NEXT STEP THERAPY" (BIN: 1001072925), registered November 25, 2024
- Principal Place of Business: Toronto, Ontario, Canada

**Conflicting Trademark Application:**
- Application Number: 2385915
- Applicant: NEXT STEP THERAPY CLINIC INC. (different entity)
- Filed: March 13, 2025 (approximately 3 months after my registration)
- Current Status: FORMALIZED, awaiting examination

As the registered entity with prior legal registration of this identical name, I wish to formally record my concern regarding potential confusion and rights overlap. Both businesses operate in the same jurisdiction (Toronto, Ontario) and provide mental health services under the same name.

I respectfully request that this information be noted during the examination process and that CIPO provide guidance on the appropriate next steps. I understand that I may need to file a Statement of Opposition once the application is advertised in the Trademarks Journal, and I am prepared to do so within the prescribed two-month window if necessary.

Please advise if any additional documentation or steps are required at this stage.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Jesse Cynamon, MPsy
