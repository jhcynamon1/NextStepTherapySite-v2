## ⚡ NOVEMBER 2025 STRATEGIC UPDATES

**Last Updated:** November 4, 2025

### 🎯 Critical Learnings That Changed Our Strategy

#### 1. Content Length Optimization Discovery
**Previous Approach (WRONG):**
- Copied B2B mechanic model (Diesel Dudes) = 1,200 words (too short)
- OR created educational encyclopedia pages = 8,000 words (too long)

**Corrected Approach (VALIDATED):**
- **Optimal Range: 2,500-4,000 words** for therapy service pages
- **Why:** Therapy = hybrid informational-transactional intent
  - Users need education to build trust (unlike mechanics)
  - But they want to take action (unlike pure research)
- **Sources:** Perplexity AI research + Firecrawl competitor analysis (Inner Oak, Brookhaven)

#### 2. Therapy Search Intent Understanding
**Previous Misunderstanding:**
- Thought therapy searches = same as mechanic/lawyer (pure transactional)
- Believed Ahrefs "informational" label meant wrong keyword target

**Corrected Understanding:**
- Therapy searches are **"hybrid informational-transactional"**
- Users research symptoms, treatment options (informational)
- But ultimate goal is booking appointment (transactional)
- Need content that builds trust AND provides clear conversion paths

#### 3. Multi-Service Hub Strategy (Inner Oak Model)
**Discovery:** Burlington's #1 competitor (Inner Oak) uses:
- Homepage = general multi-service hub
- **Separate dedicated pages for EACH condition** (anxiety, depression, ADHD, etc.)
- Service pages = 500-800 words (shorter than expected!)
- Clear differentiation by mental health condition

**Applied to Next Step Therapy:**
- Created city-level multi-service hubs (burlington-online-therapy.html)
- Created condition-specific pages (anxiety-therapy-burlington.html)
- Link between them in hub-spoke structure
- Prevents keyword cannibalization

#### 4. Burlington Consolidation Case Study (Nov 4, 2025)
**Problem Identified:**
- 3 pages competing for overlapping keywords
- 660 impressions wasted on keyword cannibalization
- anxiety page ranking for "online therapy" (wrong keyword)

**Solution Executed:**
- anxiety-therapy-burlington.html → refocused to anxiety-specific (panic, GAD, social anxiety)
- burlington-online-therapy.html → enhanced as multi-service hub
- virtual-therapy-burlington.html → 301 redirect to online therapy hub
- Sitemap updated, internal links restructured

**Expected Results (2-4 weeks):**
- 2,000-2,200 consolidated impressions across 2 focused pages
- Clear keyword targeting enables CTR optimization (Dec 1)
- Model validated for replication to other Ontario cities
