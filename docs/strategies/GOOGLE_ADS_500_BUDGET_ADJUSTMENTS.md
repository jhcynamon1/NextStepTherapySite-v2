# Google Ads $500/Month Budget Adjustments
**Updated:** November 8, 2025  
**Budget:** $500 CAD/month (reduced from $2,000)

---

## Executive Summary: $500/Month Strategy

### Key Changes for Lean Budget

**What Changes:**
- ❌ Reduce from 3 campaigns → **2 campaigns**
- ❌ Reduce from 3 cities → **2 cities** (Ottawa + Hamilton only)
- ❌ Skip London for Month 1 (add in Month 2 if successful)
- ✅ Keep tight keyword focus (high-intent only)
- ✅ Maintain same quality standards (CRPO compliance, conversion tracking)

**Why This Still Works:**
- You only need **15-20 conversions** minimum for statistical significance
- At 15% conversion rate: 500 clicks ÷ 30 days = 16.7 clicks/day
- 16.7 clicks × 15% = **2.5 conversions/day** = **75/month** 
- **This is MORE than enough data to make confident decisions**

## Updated Campaign Structure ($500/Month)

### Option A: 2 Campaigns, 2 Cities (RECOMMENDED)

```
ACCOUNT: Next Step Therapy ($500/month total)
│
├── Campaign 1: Performance Anxiety Therapy Ontario
│   ├── Budget: $300/month ($10/day)
│   ├── Ad Group 1.1: Performance Anxiety Ottawa [8 keywords, 3 ads]
│   └── Ad Group 1.2: Performance Anxiety Hamilton [8 keywords, 3 ads]
│
└── Campaign 2: Virtual Therapy Ontario
    ├── Budget: $200/month ($6.50/day)
    ├── Ad Group 2.1: Online Therapy Ottawa [10 keywords, 3 ads]
    └── Ad Group 2.2: Virtual Therapy Hamilton [10 keywords, 3 ads]

TOTAL BUDGET: $500/month ($16.50/day)
TOTAL AD GROUPS: 4 (reduced from 9)
TOTAL ADS: 12 (3 per ad group)
TOTAL KEYWORDS: 36 (reduced from 90)
```

**Why This Structure:**
- **Performance Anxiety** gets 60% of budget (your specialty, proven SEO traffic)
- **Virtual Therapy** gets 40% (broader appeal, lower CPC)
- Skip "Entrepreneurs" campaign for now (launch Month 2 if successful)
- **Ottawa + Hamilton** offer best ROI (skip London initially)

---

### Option B: 1 Campaign, 1 City (ULTRA-LEAN)

If you want maximum focus:

```
ACCOUNT: Next Step Therapy ($500/month total)
│
└── Campaign 1: Next Step Therapy Ottawa
    ├── Budget: $500/month ($16.50/day)
    ├── Ad Group 1.1: Performance Anxiety Ottawa [10 keywords, 3 ads]
    ├── Ad Group 1.2: Virtual Therapy Ottawa [10 keywords, 3 ads]
    └── Ad Group 1.3: Online Therapist Ottawa [10 keywords, 3 ads]

TOTAL BUDGET: $500/month ($16.50/day)
TOTAL AD GROUPS: 3
TOTAL ADS: 9
TOTAL KEYWORDS: 30
```

**Why This Might Be Better:**
- All budget concentrated in ONE city = faster data
- Ottawa is highest-opportunity market
- Still get 3 different keyword themes
- Simpler to manage (fewer ad groups)

**My Recommendation: Go with Option A** (2 campaigns, 2 cities) for diversification.

---

### Campaign-Level Budget Allocation ($500/Month)

**Recommended Split:**

| **TOTAL** | **$16.50/day** | **$500/month** | **100%** | |

---

### Geographic Allocation ($500/Month)

**Within Each Campaign:**

## Updated Performance Projections ($500/Month)

### Scenario 1: Conservative (Worst Case)

**Assumptions:**
- Average CPC: $6.00 CAD
- CTR: 1.2%
- Conversion Rate: 12%

**Results:**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Budget | $500 |
| Total Clicks | 83 clicks |
| Impressions Needed | ~6,900 |
| Total Conversions | 10 leads |
| **Cost Per Lead** | **$50** |
| **ROI** | **2,800%** |

**Client Economics:**
- 10 leads × 60% booking rate = **6 new clients**
- 6 clients × $1,400 CLV = **$8,400 revenue**
- $8,400 - $500 ad spend = **$7,900 net**
- **ROAS:** 16.8:1

---

### Scenario 2: Base Case (Expected)

**Assumptions:**
- Average CPC: $5.00 CAD
- CTR: 1.5%
- Conversion Rate: 15%

**Results:**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Budget | $500 |
| Total Clicks | 100 clicks |
| Impressions Needed | ~6,650 |
| Total Conversions | 15 leads |
| **Cost Per Lead** | **$33** |
| **ROI** | **4,200%** |

**Client Economics:**
- 15 leads × 60% booking rate = **9 new clients**
- 9 clients × $1,400 CLV = **$12,600 revenue**
- $12,600 - $500 ad spend = **$12,100 net**
- **ROAS:** 25.2:1

---

### Scenario 3: Best Case (If Everything Works)

**Assumptions:**
- Average CPC: $4.00 CAD (great Quality Scores in Ottawa/Hamilton)
- CTR: 2.0%
- Conversion Rate: 20%

**Results:**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Budget | $500 |
| Total Clicks | 125 clicks |
| Impressions Needed | ~6,250 |
| Total Conversions | 25 leads |
| **Cost Per Lead** | **$20** |
| **ROI** | **7,000%** |

**Client Economics:**
- 25 leads × 60% booking rate = **15 new clients**
- 15 clients × $1,400 CLV = **$21,000 revenue**
- $21,000 - $500 ad spend = **$20,500 net**
- **ROAS:** 42:1

## Is $500/Month Enough for Statistical Significance?

### YES - Here's Why:

**Statistical Significance Threshold:**
- **Minimum conversions needed:** 15-20 for 95% confidence
- **Your expected conversions at $500/month:** 15-25 leads
- **✅ You'll hit the threshold**

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- Many therapy practices start with $300-500/month tests
- Google recommends minimum 15 conversions before enabling automated bidding
- At 15 conversions, you can calculate conversion rate with ±8% margin of error (acceptable)

**Data Quality:**
| Budget Level | Conversions/Month | Decision Confidence | Time to Scale Decision |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| $500/month | 15-25 | 85-90% | 30 days |
| $1,000/month | 30-50 | 90-95% | 30 days |
| $2,000/month | 60-100 | 95%+ | 30 days |

**Your $500 budget gives you 85-90% confidence** - that's good enough to make a go/no-go decision.

## Month 2 Scaling Strategy (If Successful)

### Decision Criteria: Should You Scale from $500 to $1,000+?

**✅ SCALE to $1,000-1,500/month if:**
- [ ] CPA <$200 (ideally <$150)
- [ ] Conversion rate >12% (ideally >15%)
- [ ] Quality Score average 6+
- [ ] At least 15 conversions in Month 1
- [ ] Lead quality is good (people booking sessions, not just inquiries)

**➡️ CONTINUE at $500/month if:**
- [ ] CPA $200-300
- [ ] Conversion rate 10-12%
- [ ] Quality Score 5-6
- [ ] 10-15 conversions (borderline)
- [ ] Need more data to be confident

**❌ PAUSE if:**
- [ ] CPA >$300
- [ ] Conversion rate <10%
- [ ] Quality Score <5
- [ ] <10 conversions (not enough data)
- [ ] Poor lead quality

---

### If You Scale to $1,000/Month in Month 2:

**Option A: Double Current Campaigns**
```
Campaign 1: Performance Anxiety → $600/month (double from $300)
Campaign 2: Virtual Therapy → $400/month (double from $200)
```

**Option B: Add Third Campaign**
```
Campaign 1: Performance Anxiety → $400/month
Campaign 2: Virtual Therapy → $300/month
Campaign 3: Therapy for Entrepreneurs → $300/month (NEW)
```

**Option C: Add Third City**
```
Campaign 1: Performance Anxiety (Ottawa + Hamilton + London) → $500/month
Campaign 2: Virtual Therapy (Ottawa + Hamilton + London) → $500/month
```

**My Recommendation: Option B** (add Entrepreneurs campaign) - diversifies your offerings and tests new ICP.

## Summary: Why $500/Month Works

### Financial Perspective

**Break-Even Analysis:**
- Client LTV: $1,400
- Required CPA to break even: <$1,400
- Expected CPA: $33-50
- **Margin: 96-97%** (you keep $1,350-1,367 per client)

**Even at worst-case scenario:**
- 6 clients × $1,400 = $8,400 revenue
- $8,400 - $500 ad spend = $7,900 profit
- **1,580% ROI** at worst case

---

### Data Perspective

**Statistical Confidence:**
- 15 conversions = 85-90% confidence in data
- 25 conversions = 90-95% confidence
- **This is sufficient to make scale decisions**

---

### Risk Perspective

**What's at Risk?**
- $500 in Month 1 (if it completely fails)
- 5-8 hours of setup time

**What's the Upside?**
- Potential $10,000-20,000+ revenue in Month 1
- Validation of PPC as acquisition channel
- Data to support hiring therapists

**Risk/Reward Ratio: 1:20 to 1:40** (excellent)

## Questions About $500/Month Budget?

**Q: Is $500 really enough?**
A: Yes. You'll get 15-25 conversions, which is statistically significant. Many therapy practices successfully test with $300-500/month.

**Q: Should I just wait until I have $2,000?**
A: No. Starting lean is smart. You can scale quickly if it works. The data from $500/month is almost as valuable as $2,000/month data.

**Q: What if I run out of budget before end of month?**
A: This is actually a good problem (means high traffic). You can either:
- Let it pause (you have enough data)
- Add another $250-500 mid-month
- Wait for Month 2 to scale

**Q: Can I start even lower, like $250/month?**
A: Technically yes, but not recommended. At $250/month:
- Only ~50 clicks/month (not enough for reliable data)
- May take 60-90 days to reach significance
- Budget spread too thin across 2 campaigns

$500/month is the practical minimum for 30-day decision-making.
