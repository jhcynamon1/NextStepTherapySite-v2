## 10-Step Framework for Prompt Generation

### 1. Define the Role & Voice

Every prompt should establish:
- **Persona:** "You're a direct response marketer specialized in [industry/niche]..."
- **Tone:** Direct, warm, professional, analytical, detail-oriented
- **Audience:** High-achieving young adults, professionals juggling anxiety/overwhelm/existential issues
- **Constraints:** CRPO compliance, PHIPA compliance, elevated brand experience, trust-building focus

**Template:**
```
"You're a direct response marketer specialized in [private therapy clinics serving high-achieving young professionals with anxiety/overwhelm/existential issues] who perfectly blends influence and persuasion across every potential customer touchpoint — while maintaining an elevated brand experience that builds trust and goodwill with my prospects."
```

### 2. Define the Objective & Outcome

Specify:
- **What** the AI should generate (funnel plan, copy, content strategy, etc.)
- **Format** of output (bullet list, ranked list, table, action plan, narrative)
- **Metrics/Goals** (improve conversion, reduce time-to-value, improve LTV)

**Examples:**
- "Create a step-by-step marketing funnel plan"
- "Write copy that addresses pain points for first-year university students"
- "Generate content ideas to drive qualified traffic"
- "Optimize landing page for better conversion"

### 3. Provide Context & Constraints

Include:
- **Background:** Your niche, target client, offer structure, brand promise
- **Constraints:** Budget, tools (low/no-code preferred), compliance requirements, tone, style
- **Examples:** "Use this style...", "Refer to these principles...", "Rank by impact and effort"

**Key Contexts to Always Include:**
- CRPO guidelines (no comparisons, no superiority claims)
- PHIPA compliance
- Target age range and demographics
- Geographic focus (Ontario)
- Therapy modality (virtual/online)

### 4. Use Influence, Persuasion & Marketing Psychology

Request the AI to address:
- **Competitor gaps** and differentiation opportunities
- **Pain points** specific to your ICP
- **Buying psychology principles:** Authority, reciprocity, scarcity, social proof
- **Offer ladder:** Entry-level → Core → Premium (to improve LTV)
- **Funnel structure** focused on reducing time to value and maximizing trust

**Key Psychological Triggers for Therapy Marketing:**
- Fear of judgment → "Safe, non-judgmental space"
- Uncertainty about therapy → "Clear process, what to expect"
- Stigma → "Normal, common, you're not alone"
- Urgency (ethical) → "Limited availability, next opening"
- Authority → Credentials, specializations, evidence-based
- Social proof → Testimonials (with consent), success indicators (not guarantees)

### 5. Output Requirements

Specify:
- **Format:** "Provide a step-by-step plan with ranked opportunities by impact & effort"
- **Tools:** "Include low-/no-code tool suggestions"
- **Traffic strategies:** "How can we drive more qualified traffic?"
- **Blind spots:** "What opportunities am I missing?"

**Preferred Output Structure:**
1. Executive Summary
2. Detailed Breakdown
3. Priority Action Items (ranked by impact/effort)
