## Executive Summary

### Key Findings

**Market Opportunity:**
- Ottawa, Hamilton, and London offer 60-70% less PPC competition than Toronto while maintaining 50-70% of Toronto's search volume
- High-intent therapy keywords in Ontario markets range from CAD $2.50-$8.50 CPC (vs $6-12 in Toronto)
- Virtual therapy positioning creates immediate scalability without geographic limitations
- **Estimated minimum viable test budget: $600-900/month (CAD) for 2-3 months**

**Recommended Starting Strategy:**
- **Campaign Type:** Search campaigns only (avoid Performance Max and Display initially)
- **Geographic Focus:** Ottawa ($1,000/mo), Hamilton ($600/mo), London ($500/mo), Toronto retargeting only ($400/mo)
- **Timeline:** 30-day foundation setup → 30-day testing → 30-day optimization → scale decision at Month 3
- **Expected Outcomes:** 180-300 clicks/month, 45-75 leads at 25% conversion rate, cost per lead $60-175 CAD

### Strategic Positioning Analysis

Based on your strategic documents, here's your current position:

**Target Market & Ideal Client Profile:**
- **Primary ICP:** Young professionals (25-35) in Ottawa, Hamilton, London - NOT Toronto (oversaturated)
- **Secondary:** University students seeking fast-track therapy (vs 4-8 week campus waitlists)
- **Tertiary:** Men in high-stress careers (30-45) - underserved market segment

**Current Performance Baseline:**
- 7,000 monthly impressions, 50 clicks/month (0.7% CTR) from organic search
- **PPC Advantage:** Immediate visibility for validated keywords (performance anxiety 300 vol, entrepreneurs 250 vol, imposter syndrome 200 vol)
- Virtual-first model = 100% of Ontario addressable market from day one

**Growth Goals:**
- Prove demand: 30-40 qualified leads/month to justify hiring 2-3 therapists
- Revenue model: Scale from $3,500/month → $25K-50K/month through therapist leasing
- **PPC Role:** De-risk expansion by validating demand BEFORE hiring therapists

**Critical Constraints:**
- ✅ CRPO compliance mandatory (no outcome guarantees, no testimonials, qualified language only)
- ✅ $1,000-3,000/month test budget maximum
- ✅ Must integrate with existing SEO strategy (avoid keyword cannibalization)
- ✅ CRPO #10979 - must be prominent in all ads

## Step 3: Strategic Analysis Questions

### 1. Market Entry: Broad vs. Niche Targeting?

**Recommendation: NICHE DOWN IMMEDIATELY**

**Rationale:**
- Your current SEO strategy already targets niche keywords (performance anxiety, entrepreneurs, imposter syndrome)
- Broad terms like "therapy Toronto" cost $6-12/click with 160+ competitor practices
- Your validated low-competition keywords cost $2.50-5.00/click with proven search volume

**Launch Strategy:**
```
Phase 1 Launch (Month 1):
├── Campaign 1: Performance Anxiety Therapy Ontario ($800/mo budget)
│   ├── Ad Group: Performance Anxiety Therapy Ottawa
│   ├── Ad Group: Performance Anxiety Therapy Hamilton  
│   └── Ad Group: Performance Anxiety Therapy London
│
├── Campaign 2: Therapy for Entrepreneurs Ontario ($600/mo budget)
│   ├── Ad Group: Therapy for Entrepreneurs Ottawa
│   ├── Ad Group: Business Owner Therapy Ottawa
│   └── Ad Group: Entrepreneur Burnout Therapy
│
└── Campaign 3: Virtual Therapy Ontario ($600/mo budget)
    ├── Ad Group: Online Therapy Ottawa
    ├── Ad Group: Virtual Therapy Hamilton
    └── Ad Group: Virtual Therapy London

TOTAL: $2,000/month distributed across 9 tightly-themed ad groups
```

**Why this works:**
- Aligns with existing SEO content (performance-anxiety-therapy-ontario.html already exists)
- Targets validated search volume (performance anxiety 300/mo, entrepreneurs 250/mo)
- Avoids Toronto saturation, focuses on Ottawa/Hamilton/London arbitrage opportunity
- Each ad group has dedicated landing page = higher Quality Score = lower CPC

---

### 2. Budget Efficiency: Minimum Budget for Significant Data?

**Answer: $2,000/month minimum for 3 months ($6,000 total test investment)**

**Breakdown:**
- **Daily Budget:** $65-70/day
- **Expected CPCs:** $3.50-6.00 average across Ontario Tier 1 cities
- **Expected Clicks:** 270-320 clicks/month
- **Statistical Significance:** Need 15-20 conversions/month minimum for reliable data
- **At 25% conversion rate:** 270 clicks × 25% = 67-68 leads/month

**Budget Allocation by City:**
| City | Monthly Budget | Daily Budget | Expected Clicks/Mo | Expected Leads (25% CVR) |
|------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Ottawa | $800 | $26 | 110-130 | 27-32 |
| Hamilton | $600 | $20 | 85-100 | 21-25 |
| London | $500 | $17 | 70-85 | 17-21 |
| **TOTAL** | **$1,900** | **$63** | **265-315** | **65-78 leads/mo** |

**Why $2,000 is the floor:**
- Below this, you're spreading budget too thin across 3 cities
- Need 15-20 conversions PER CAMPAIGN to enable automated bidding
- Below 100 clicks/month per campaign = statistically unreliable data
- Industry research shows therapy practices need minimum 2-3 months at this budget to reach conclusions

**If budget is tighter ($1,000/month):**
- Focus on ONE city only (Ottawa) with 3 niche campaigns
- Extend test period to 4-6 months (slower data accumulation)
- Accept that you'll be slower to scale but still get reliable validation

---

### 3. Competitive Gaps: Differentiation Opportunities

Based on competitor analysis (NuVista, BeWell Clinics, New Moon Psychotherapy), here are exploitable gaps:

**Ad Copy Differentiation:**

| Competitor Weakness | Your Opportunity | Example Ad Copy |
|---------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Generic "therapy for everyone" messaging | **Niche specialization** | "Performance Anxiety Therapy – CRPO Therapist Specializing in High-Achievers" |
| No urgency/availability signals | **"Available This Week"** (proven 1.7% CTR on your homepage) | "Online Therapy Ottawa – CRPO Registered – Available This Week" |
| Corporate/clinical language | **Direct, no-BS tone** (aligns with your "Straight Up Health" preference) | "Therapy for Entrepreneurs – Virtual Sessions That Fit Your Schedule" |
| No CRPO# in ads | **Highlight CRPO #10979** (trust signal) | "CRPO #10979 Registered Psychotherapist – Virtual Therapy Ontario" |
| Focus on Toronto only | **Ottawa/Hamilton/London focus** | "Hamilton Therapy – No Waitlist, Virtual Sessions Available" |

**Landing Page Gaps:**

Competitors are making these mistakes (opportunities for you):

1. **Generic service pages** - Your existing niche pages (performance-anxiety-therapy-ontario.html) are better
2. **No "Available This Week" urgency** - Add this to all PPC landing pages
3. **Weak CTAs** - Your homepage has 16 clear CTAs; competitors have 2-3
4. **Missing free consultation offers** - Add prominent "Free 15-Min Consultation" CTA
5. **Buried CRPO credentials** - Make CRPO #10979 hero section content

**Offer Structure Gap:**

Most competitors offer:
- ❌ "Book a session" (no incentive, high friction)

**Your differentiated offer:**
- ✅ "Free 15-Minute Consultation" (lower friction, builds trust)
- ✅ "Available This Week" (urgency without pressure, CRPO-compliant)
- ✅ "No Waitlist" (addresses major pain point - campus counseling 4-8 week waits)

---

### 4. Conversion Path: Phone Calls vs. Form Submissions?

**Recommendation: OPTIMIZE FOR BOTH, PRIORITIZE FORMS**

**User's current data:**
- "3 new clients but no one's filled out contact form"
- → Clients calling directly OR booking via Jane

**Conversion Tracking Priority:**

**Priority 1: Jane Booking Clicks** (IMMEDIATE SETUP)
```javascript
// Already implemented in your index.html (lines 42-52)
document.querySelectorAll('a[href*="janeapp.com"]').forEach(link => {
    link.addEventListener('click', function() {
        gtag('event', 'booking_click', {
            'event_category': 'conversion',
            'event_label': 'jane_app_booking',
            'value': 175,
            'currency': 'CAD'
        });
    });
});
```
✅ **Action:** Verify this is firing in GA4, then import as Google Ads conversion

**Priority 2: Phone Call Clicks** (IMMEDIATE SETUP)
```javascript
// Already implemented in your index.html (lines 31-40)
document.querySelectorAll('a[href^="tel:"]').forEach(link => {
    link.addEventListener('click', function() {
        gtag('event', 'phone_call', {
            'event_category': 'conversion',
            'value': 175,
            'currency': 'CAD'
        });
    });
});
```
✅ **Action:** Import phone_call event as Google Ads conversion

**Priority 3: Contact Form Submissions** (ADD TO PPC LANDING PAGES)
- Add simple 3-field form: Name, Email, "I'm seeking help for: [dropdown]"
- Confirmation page triggers conversion event
- Lower friction than Jane booking (some users want to ask questions first)

**Conversion Path Strategy:**
```
PPC Ad Click
    ↓
Landing Page (performance-anxiety-therapy-ontario.html)
    ↓
    ├─→ 60%: Click phone number (tracked conversion)
    ├─→ 30%: Click Jane booking button (tracked conversion)
    └─→ 10%: Fill contact form (NEW conversion to add)
```

**Why both matter:**
- **Phone calls:** Immediate help-seekers, crisis situations, older demographics (40+)
- **Jane bookings:** Self-service preference, younger demographics (25-35), "research first" types
- **Contact forms:** "Not ready to commit but curious" - nurture these into bookings

**Attribution Window:**
- Set 30-day click, 1-day view conversion window
- Therapy is considered purchase; people research 1-3 weeks before booking

---

### 5. Quick Wins: Fastest Path to Launch Without Major Website Overhaul?

**7-Day Launch Plan (No Website Changes Required)**

**Days 1-2: Foundation Setup**
- ✅ Create Google Ads account
- ✅ Link GA4 (you already have G-J8H4YBGSHR)
- ✅ Import existing conversion events (jane_app_booking, phone_call) as Google Ads conversions
- ✅ Install Google Ads conversion tracking tag

**Days 3-4: Campaign Build**
- ✅ Create 3 Search campaigns (Performance Anxiety, Entrepreneurs, Virtual Therapy)
- ✅ Build 9 ad groups (3 cities × 3 themes)
- ✅ Write 15 ad variations (CRPO-compliant, using templates in Section below)
- ✅ Add negative keywords list (100+ terms - see templates section)

**Days 5-6: Landing Page Optimization**
- ✅ **Use EXISTING pages** - no new pages needed:
  - performance-anxiety-therapy-ontario.html (already exists)
  - imposter-syndrome-therapy-professionals-toronto.html (expand to Ontario)
  - virtual-therapy-ontario.html (already exists)

- ✅ **Make these 3 changes to PPC landing pages:**
  1. Add "Available This Week" to hero section (proven 1.7% CTR)
  2. Make phone number and Jane booking button more prominent
  3. Add "Free 15-Minute Consultation" CTA above the fold

**Day 7: Launch & Monitor**
- ✅ Set daily budget limits ($65/day total)
- ✅ Enable ad scheduling (Monday-Friday 9am-8pm to start)
- ✅ Launch campaigns
- ✅ Monitor for ad approval (healthcare ads sometimes need manual review)

**Why this is fastest:**
- Uses existing high-quality landing pages (2,500-4,000 words, proper schema, FAQ sections)
- Only 3 minor tweaks needed (urgency language, CTA prominence, free consultation offer)
- Existing GA4 conversion tracking already captures phone + Jane bookings
- No form builder, no new content, no developer time required

**First Week Expectations:**
- **Days 1-3:** Ad approval process (healthcare ads can take 24-48 hours)
- **Days 4-7:** Initial clicks start flowing (expect 10-15 clicks in first week)
- **Week 2:** Full budget deployed, 50-60 clicks
- **Week 3+:** Consistent 270-320 clicks/month, 65-78 leads/month

### 6. Seasonality: Predictable Patterns to Time Launch Around?

**YES - Major Seasonality Patterns in Therapy Searches**

**Peak Seasons (Highest Search Volume):**

| Time Period | Search Volume Change | Why It Matters | Budget Recommendation |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Late Aug - Early Dec** | +125% (seasonal depression ramp-up) | Highest demand period of year | Front-load 60% of annual ad spend here |
| **January (New Year)** | +40-50% (resolutions, post-holiday blues) | Second-highest peak | Increase budget 30-40% vs. baseline |
| **Back-to-School (Sept)** | +30% (student stress, transitions) | Strong for university student ICP | Target campus-area keywords |
| **Pre-Holidays (Nov-Dec)** | +50-60% (holiday anxiety, family stress) | Couples therapy especially high | Emphasize couples/family services |

**Low Seasons (Reduced Search Volume):**
- **Late Spring / Summer (May-July):** -20-30% drop in therapy searches
- **Major Holidays:** Christmas Day, Thanksgiving, Easter (pause ads these days)

**Optimal Launch Timing:**

**Option A: LAUNCH NOW (November 2025) - RECOMMENDED**
- ✅ **Pros:**
  - Riding seasonal depression surge (peaks 3rd week of November)
  - Pre-holiday anxiety spike coming
  - January resolution surge immediately follows
  - 3-month test completes by Feb 2025 (in time for spring planning)

- ❌ **Cons:**
  - Holiday season can have higher CPCs (more competition)
  - December 20-Jan 2 may have reduced conversion rates (people delay booking during holidays)

**Option B: Wait for January 2026**
- ✅ **Pros:**
  - New Year resolution surge = high intent
  - "Fresh start" messaging resonates
  - Less holiday distractions

- ❌ **Cons:**
  - Miss 8-10 weeks of peak seasonal demand (late Aug-Dec)
  - January surge ends by mid-February
  - Competition increases in January (other advertisers launch then too)

**Recommendation: LAUNCH IMMEDIATELY (November 2025)**

**Rationale:**
- Current seasonality peak continues through December
- Early January captures resolution surge
- 3-month test completes by February (can scale into spring/summer if successful)
- Even if December conversions slow, you're gathering data during highest-intent period

**Budget Pacing Calendar:**

| Month | Budget Multiplier | Daily Budget | Rationale |
|-------|------------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Nov 2025** | 1.5x baseline | $95/day | Peak SAD season, launch momentum |
| **Dec 2025** | 1.2x baseline | $75/day | Maintain presence through holidays |
| **Jan 2026** | 1.5x baseline | $95/day | New Year resolution surge |
| **Feb 2026** | 1.0x baseline | $63/day | Scale decision month, normalize |
| **Mar-Apr 2026** | 0.8x baseline | $50/day | Lower season, maintain presence |
| **May-Jul 2026** | 0.6x baseline | $38/day | Summer low, test only |
| **Aug 2026** | 1.3x baseline | $82/day | Ramp up for fall surge |

**Day-of-Week Patterns:**
- **Highest search days:** Monday, Tuesday (+10-15% vs. Friday/Saturday)
- **Lowest search days:** Friday evening, all day Saturday
- **Action:** Set bid adjustments: +15% Mon-Tue, -10% Fri-Sat

**Time-of-Day Patterns:**
- **Peak search times:** 6pm-10pm local time (evening reflection time)
- **Low search times:** 6am-11am (work/school hours)
- **Action:** Ad scheduling: Run ads 9am-10pm, increase bids 6pm-10pm (+20%)

### 7. SEO Integration: Preventing PPC and SEO Cannibalization

**The Cannibalization Risk:**
- You're already ranking for some keywords organically (virtual therapy ontario: 1,330 impressions/mo)
- Running PPC for the same keywords = paying for clicks you'd get organically

**Integration Strategy: COMPLEMENTARY, NOT COMPETITIVE**

**PPC-Only Keywords (No Organic Presence Yet):**
```
├── Therapy for entrepreneurs (250 vol, KD 10)
│   └── PPC: Immediate visibility while SEO page ranks over 3-6 months
│
├── Performance anxiety therapy Ottawa (local variant)
│   └── PPC: City-specific terms you don't rank for yet
│
└── Online therapy Hamilton / London
    └── PPC: Geographic expansion faster than SEO
```

**SEO-Strong Keywords (Avoid PPC):**
```
├── Virtual therapy Ontario (you rank, 1,330 impressions/mo)
│   └── ❌ NO PPC - already getting organic clicks
│
└── Burlington keywords (you rank in top 10)
    └── ❌ NO PPC initially - organic performing well
```

**Hybrid Approach (PPC + SEO Both Run):**
```
├── Performance anxiety therapy Ontario
│   ├── SEO: Existing page, moderate rankings
│   └── PPC: Run ads to capture additional traffic + test messaging
│
└── ADHD therapy (if you add this service)
    ├── SEO: Build content over time
    └── PPC: Immediate lead generation while SEO builds
```

**Cannibalization Prevention Tactics:**

1. **Geographic Differentiation:**
   - **SEO Focus:** Toronto, Burlington (existing content)
   - **PPC Focus:** Ottawa, Hamilton, London (weak organic presence, high opportunity)

2. **Intent Differentiation:**
   - **SEO:** Capture "research/educational" intent ("what is performance anxiety therapy")
   - **PPC:** Capture "ready to book" intent ("therapist near me available today")

3. **Keyword Modifiers:**
   - **SEO Keywords:** "therapy for...", "counseling for...", "help with..."
   - **PPC Keywords:** "therapist available", "online therapy booking", "virtual therapy appointment"

4. **Landing Page Strategy:**
   - **SEO Pages:** Longer (2,500-4,000 words), educational, FAQ-heavy
   - **PPC Pages:** Shorter (800-1,200 words), conversion-focused, prominent CTAs

5. **Attribution Analysis:**
   - Use GA4 "Model Comparison Tool" to see if PPC assists SEO conversions
   - Track "PPC click → organic return visit → conversion" path
   - May discover PPC ads build awareness that leads to organic branded searches later

**Monthly Review Process:**
1. Export organic keyword rankings from GSC
2. Cross-reference with PPC keyword list
3. If keyword moves to Position 1-3 organically:
   - → Test pausing PPC for that keyword
   - → Monitor if conversion volume drops
   - → If conversions stay flat, redirect PPC budget elsewhere
4. If PPC keyword never ranks organically after 6 months:
   - → Continue PPC indefinitely (SEO weakness)

**Expected Outcome:**
- 70% of PPC budget goes to keywords with weak/no organic presence
- 30% overlaps with SEO keywords (for maximum SERP visibility)
- Combined PPC + SEO = 1.5-2x more conversions than SEO alone
