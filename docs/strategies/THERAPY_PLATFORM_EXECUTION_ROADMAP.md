# NextStep Therapy Platform - Execution Roadmap
**Launch Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Model:** Phased validation approach (Test → Validate → Scale)  
**Total Investment:** $25,000 over 18 months  
**Goal:** 35-45 clients/month by Month 18, $6K-9K/month profit

---

## Research-Validated Assumptions

### Market Reality (From Ahrefs + Competitor Analysis):
- **Total Toronto therapy searches:** 4,000-4,500/month
- **Position #1 in GBP local pack:** 15-25 clients/month (not 40-60)
- **Review threshold for top 3:** 20-30 reviews (achievable in 12-18 months)
- **Current top 3 performance:**
  - Couple Therapy Toronto: Position #1, 10 reviews, ~10-15 clients/month
  - Toronto Psychotherapy Group: Position #2, 11 reviews, DR 19, 1,700 visits/month
  - Well Beings Counselling: Position #3, 13 reviews, DR 36, 3,200 Canadian visits/month

### Critical Constraints:
- **Review velocity:** <2% due to CRPO ethical rules (can't solicit reviews)
- **Timeline to top 3:** 12-18 months (not 6 months)
- **Tech costs:** $2K-3K (bootstrap with Acuity + Stripe + WordPress)
- **Your advantage:** Existing NextStepTherapy.ca brand, DR 2.7, can build reviews from YOUR clients

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Risk #1: GBP Optimization Doesn't Work (30% probability)
**Mitigation:**
- Test for only 3 months before major investment
- Total loss: $2,500 (not $25,000)
- Can pivot to different strategy

### Risk #2: Can't Get Reviews Fast Enough (40% probability)
**Mitigation:**
- Use YOUR existing clients for first 10-15 reviews
- Only need 20-25 reviews to compete (not 50+)
- Timeline is 12-18 months (realistic given CRPO rules)

### Risk #3: Can't Recruit Therapists (20% probability)
**Mitigation:**
- Don't recruit until you have proven client flow
- Start with 1 therapist (low commitment)
- Non-exclusive model (easier recruitment)
- 62% commission is competitive

### Risk #4: Competition Responds (25% probability)
**Mitigation:**
- Current top 3 have low review counts (10-13)
- Many aren't optimized (no posts, old photos)
- You can outwork them with 2x/week posting
- Content strategy differentiates (Well Beings model)

---

## What Makes This Plan Work

### 1. You Start With Unfair Advantages:
- ✅ Existing NextStepTherapy.ca brand (DR 2.7)
- ✅ You're already a therapist (can build reviews yourself)
- ✅ You have clients now (review generation source)
- ✅ You have SEO skills (proven 0→400 impressions)

### 2. Phased Risk Reduction:
- Month 3: Only $2,500 at risk
- Month 6: Only $8,000 at risk
- Month 12: $18,000 at risk (but revenue offsetting)

### 3. You Can Bail Anytime:
- Month 3: If not working, stop
- Month 6: If slow, continue small or stop
- Month 12: If struggling, plateau at 2-3 therapists

### 4. Dual Revenue Streams:
- Your therapy income (Months 1-9)
- Platform commission (Months 4+)
- No income cliff like full-time entrepreneurs face

## The Simple Answer to "When Do I Hire Therapists?"

**You hire them when you can't handle all the inquiries yourself.**

**Timeline:**
- Month 1-3: Just you (testing GBP)
- Month 4-6: You + 1 therapist (validation)
- Month 7-9: You + 2 therapists (early scale)
- Month 10-12: 3-4 therapists, you're part-time clinical
- Month 13-18: 5-9 therapists, you're full-time platform

**You recruit AFTER validation, not before.**
