# Next Step Therapy Google Ads Strategy: Complete Implementation Blueprint

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: GO/NO-GO DECISION

### VERDICT: **CONDITIONAL GO** - Launch After 2-Week Landing Page Build

**Budget Assessment:** $500/month is VIABLE but constrained. **Recommended: Start at $600-900/month** for meaningful results.

**Expected ROI at $900/month:** 4.5-11.7X return (3-7 new clients monthly generating $4,050-$10,500 revenue vs $900 spend)

### Top 3 Opportunities:

1. **Pricing Transparency Leadership** - Only 3 of 8 competitors show clear pricing. Lead with "$175/session | Insurance Accepted" to capture price-conscious searchers immediately.

2. **Anti-CBT Positioning Gap** - Market is saturated with generic CBT messaging. Position ACT therapy as "Not Your Average Talk Therapy" for prospects who've tried traditional approaches unsuccessfully.

3. **Free Consultation + Same-Week Availability** - Most competitors have waitlists or unclear booking processes. Emphasize "Free 15-Min Call | Start This Week" to capture high-intent traffic.

### Critical Prerequisites (DO NOT START ADS WITHOUT THESE):

❌ **Current website is 60% ready** - needs dedicated landing pages  
✅ Strong credentials (CRPO #10979) and transparent pricing ($175)  
❌ Missing testimonials (CRITICAL trust signal gap)  
❌ Homepage has too many navigation links (wastes paid traffic)  

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks to prepare, then launch with $600-900/month budget.

## COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE REPORT

### Market Landscape: HIGH Competition, CLEAR Differentiation Opportunities

**Top 8 Competitors Analyzed:**
- Layla Care (matching service, transparent pricing at $180)
- Virtual CBT Psychotherapy (results-focused, "6 sessions" messaging)  
- The Mindful Adult ($399 ADHD assessments, speed positioning)
- Springboard Clinic (comprehensive ADHD, NO pricing shown)
- The Curious Collective (**BEST brand voice** - authentic, relatable, lived experience)
- Mindful Living Centre (full-service, ketamine therapy innovation)
- MindBeacon (FREE OHIP-funded - major competitive threat)
- First Session (directory with video intros - unique differentiator)

### Critical Competitive Gaps to Exploit:

**1. Pricing Opacity (MAJOR OPPORTUNITY)**
- 5 of 8 competitors hide pricing completely
- Creates massive friction for price-sensitive clients
- **Your Advantage:** "$175/session" in all ads + landing pages = instant trust

**2. CBT Fatigue**
- Nearly universal CBT positioning creates sameness
- Alienates clients who've tried CBT without success
- **Your Advantage:** "ACT Therapy: Not Your Average CBT" positioning

**3. Generic "Personalized Care" Claims**
- Everyone claims "compassionate," "collaborative," "trauma-informed"
- Meaningless differentiation through overuse
- **Your Advantage:** Specific ACT methodology + sports ops background + "anti-cliché" voice

**4. Booking Friction**
- Many require "intake call" before therapy booking
- Multiple steps = abandoned leads
- **Your Advantage:** Direct booking + free consultation = lower barrier

**5. Male-Focused Gap**
- Most therapy advertising targets general or female audiences
- High-achieving professional men underserved
- **Your Advantage:** "Therapy for Men | No Therapy Clichés" dedicated campaign

### Competitive Pricing Structure:
- Supervised: $55-100
- RSW/RP: **$150-180** ← Your $175 positioning (mid-tier pricing, premium value)
- Psychologists: $240-270
- ADHD assessments: $399

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### GO/NO-GO: **CONDITIONAL GO**

**Verdict:** Google Ads is HIGHLY VIABLE for Next Step Therapy - BUT NOT with current website setup.

### Prerequisites (2-3 weeks):

**MUST COMPLETE:**
1. Build 2-3 dedicated landing pages
2. Collect 5+ social proof elements
3. Make CRPO badge ultra-prominent
4. Create "About Jesse" section
5. Optimize mobile experience
6. Set up conversion tracking

**Investment:** 40-60 hours OR $2,000-4,000 professional development

**ROI of prep:** 3-5X more conversions = investment back in first 2-4 clients

### Budget Recommendation:

- **Minimum:** $500/month (viable but slow)
- **Recommended:** $900/month (meaningful data)
- **Optimal:** $1,200-1,500/month (robust testing)

### Expected Results at $900/month:

- Month 1: 1-2 clients
- Month 2: 2-4 clients
- Month 3: 3-7 clients
- **Average by Month 3: 3-5 clients/month**
- **ROI: 4.5-11.7X ($4,050-10,500 revenue vs $900 spend)**

### Competitive Advantages:

1. **Pricing transparency** (only 3 of 8 show pricing)
2. **ACT positioning** (vs saturated CBT)
3. **Anti-cliché brand voice**
4. **Free consultation** (barrier reduction)
5. **Professional focus** (underserved niche)
6. **Male-friendly messaging**
7. **Sports ops background** (unique credibility)

### Highest-Leverage Actions (If You Only Do 3 Things):

1. **Create dedicated landing pages** (173% more leads)
2. **Lead with "$175/session | Insurance Accepted"** in all ads
3. **Answer calls within 1 hour** (7X higher conversion)

### Timeline Summary:

- **Weeks 1-3:** Prepare
- **Week 4:** Launch $500-900/month
- **Months 2-3:** Optimize, first clients
- **Months 4-6:** Scale to $1,200-1,500/month (5-10 clients)
- **Months 7-12:** Mature performance (10-15 clients)
- **Year 2+:** Multi-therapist ($3,000-5,000/month, 20-30+ clients)

### Risk Assessment:

**LOW RISK if:**
- 3-month commitment
- $900/month budget
- Landing pages completed
- CRPO compliance followed
- 1-hour lead response

**HIGH RISK if:**
- Launch without landing pages
- Use client testimonials
- Don't answer calls
- Give up after 1 month
