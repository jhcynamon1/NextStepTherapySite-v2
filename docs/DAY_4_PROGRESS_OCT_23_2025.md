anxiety-therapy-burlington.html (position 22)
    ↓
Target: Page 1 (positions 1-10)
```

### Topical Relevance:
- Homepage links from **anxiety** context → Burlington page
- anxiety-therapy-ontario.html → specific Burlington anxiety page
- Creates clear topical silo: anxiety → location

### User Journey:
- Generic pages (homepage, ontario pages) → specific service pages
