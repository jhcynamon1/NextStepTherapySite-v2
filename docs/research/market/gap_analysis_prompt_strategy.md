You are a rigorous strategic advisor. We are refining the "Vertical Incubator MSO" model for a solo RP in Ontario.

The user has pushed back on several key assumptions from the previous Gemini reports. We need a new Deep Research prompt to close these specific gaps.

### GAP 1: The "Churn vs. Replacement" Math (The Infinite Supply Fallacy)
*   **User's Challenge:** "Why do I care about retention? If a therapist leaves, I just hire a new one. Isn't it better to keep charging 40% to new people than 20% to old people?"
*   **The Gap:** We need to model the *cost of turnover*. Recruitment costs, onboarding time, "ramp up" periods where revenue is low, and the *risk* of running out of good therapists. Is the "infinite supply" of quality therapists a myth in Ontario?

### GAP 2: Optimal Pricing Sensitivity (Finding the "Goldilocks" Cap)
*   **User's Challenge:** "$2,500 is just a number we made up."
*   **The Gap:** What is the *actual* break point? Is it $2,000? $3,000? We need a sensitivity analysis. At what point does the therapist say "screw it, I'm leaving"? At what point does the MSO lose money?

### GAP 3: The "Real" CAC (Zero is a Myth)
*   **User's Challenge:** "The report assumes CAC is near zero. This is negligent."
*   **The Gap:** We need a realistic CAC model that includes:
    *   Founder's time (opportunity cost).
    *   Content production costs (if scaling beyond founder).
    *   Paid Ads (to supplement SEO).
    *   "pSEO Decay" (ranking drops).

### GAP 4: The "Incubator" Product Mix (Service vs. Course)
*   **User's Challenge:** "Too much focus on courses. Upsells should be Websites, SEO, Apps, Branding."
*   **The Gap:** Validate the demand for *Practice Building Services* vs. *Creator Courses*. Do therapists want to pay for a "Premium Brand Package"? What is the willingness to pay?

### GAP 5: The "App Liability" Reality Check
*   **User's Challenge:** "Why is a CBT homework app a medical device? That seems like an overreaction."
*   **The Gap:** Distinguish clearly between *Clinical Decision Support* (High Risk) and *Patient Education/Self-Help* (Low Risk). Find specific Health Canada examples of "Wellness Apps" that are unregulated.

### GAP 6: Market Depth (Demand Side)
*   **User's Challenge:** "Is the market big enough to feed all these therapists?"
*   **The Gap:** Total Addressable Market (TAM) analysis for *private-pay* therapy in Ontario. How many people can actually afford $175/session? When do we hit the ceiling?

### THE TASK
Construct a new Deep Research Prompt that specifically targets these 6 gaps. Do not ask generic questions. Ask for data, models, and precedents.
