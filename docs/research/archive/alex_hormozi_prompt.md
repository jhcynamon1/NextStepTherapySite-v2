You are Alex Hormozi.

I am a solo Registered Psychotherapist in Ontario looking to scale my practice, "Next Step Therapy," into a $2M-$5M profit enterprise. I have a specific unfair advantage: I am a "vibe coder" with strong AI/pSEO skills (113 pages indexed, owning niche keywords) and a clinical background.

I have identified a potential business model—the **"Vertical Incubator MSO"**—but I need you to restructure the offer, the pricing psychology, and the execution plan using your **"Grand Slam Offer" framework**.

Here is the context you need:

### THE CORE CONSTRAINTS (The "Physics" of My Market)
1.  **Regulatory Hard Line:** As a Registered Psychotherapist, I cannot pay or receive commissions for referrals (CRPO Standard 1.9). "Fee-splitting" is a gray area; "Management Fees" for tangible services are compliant.
2.  **The Churn Problem:** In a standard 70/30 split model, therapists leave once their caseload is full because they hate paying 30% of their gross forever.
3.  **The Goal:** $500k - $2M annual profit. "Path of least resistance."

### THE PROPOSED MODEL: "The Incubator"
Instead of just being a clinic, I become a "Shopify for Therapists."
*   **Acquisition:** I fill their caseloads using my pSEO engine (near-zero CAC).
*   **Retention (The Moat):** I use my coding skills to build them proprietary AI tools (e.g., "Panic Attack Tracker for Bay St Lawyers") and handle their admin/billing.
*   **Monetization:** A "Graduated MSO" model. They start on a % split, but it **caps** at a certain amount (e.g., $2,500/mo) to prevent them from leaving.

### YOUR TASK:
Build the **Grand Slam Offer** for this model.

**1. The Value Equation:**
*   Break down the offer components. How do we make the value of the "Incubator" so high that *not* joining feels stupid?
*   Specifically, how do we position the "Capped Fee" psychology? (The user asked: "Why not offer the cap Day 1? Doesn't that build trust?")
*   What are the "Bonuses" and "Guarantees" we can legally offer?

**2. The Pricing Strategy:**
*   Hormozi-fy the "Graduated MSO" pricing. Is it a "Tuition Model"? A "Licensing Fee"?
*   How do we frame the $2,500/mo cap so it feels like a massive discount rather than a cost?
*   Validate the math: Does the "Groupon for Therapists" idea (wholesale discounts on Jane App, insurance, etc.) actually move the needle, or is it distraction?

**3. The "Magic" Deliverables (Vibe Coding):**
*   I can build custom apps for their specific niches (e.g., "The Lawyer's Anxiety Toolkit").
*   How do we package this? Is it a "Tech Stack" fee?
*   How do we use this to create "Product-Led Retention"?

**4. The "Incubator" Promise:**
*   The user wants to help them "build their own brands." Is this smart, or are we training our competitors?
*   If we help them build their own brand, how do we ensure they pay us forever?

**5. The Execution Roadmap (Next 90 Days):**
*   Step 1: How to validate this offer *without* building the tech first.
*   Step 2: The "Beta Group" pitch to the first 3 therapists.
*   Step 3: The exact script to close them.

**Tone:** Direct, no fluff, focus on leverage and offer psychology.
