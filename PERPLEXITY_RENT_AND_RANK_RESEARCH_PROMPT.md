# üè¢ RENT-AND-RANK MARKET RESEARCH: Ontario Therapy Website Rentals
*CRPO-Compliant Website Rental Business Model Analysis*

---

## üìã RESEARCH OBJECTIVE

**Analyze the viability of renting high-ranking therapy websites to Ontario therapists and clinics as a CRPO-compliant alternative to lead generation services.**

**Business Model:** Build and rank websites like "anxiety-therapy-toronto.com" then rent exclusive access to therapists for $800-3,000/month. Therapist gets ALL traffic and leads from that site.

**Key Compliance Factor:** This is a marketing service rental (CRPO compliant), NOT lead sales (CRPO violation).
