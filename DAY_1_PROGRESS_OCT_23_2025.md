## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Sitemap Audit (30 mins) ‚úÖ

**Created:** `/tmp/audit_sitemap.sh` - Comprehensive sitemap analysis script

**Key Findings:**
- **Total URLs in sitemap:** 94
- **URLs with .html extension:** 31
- **URLs without .html extension:** 62
- **Duplicate pairs found:** 1 (depression-therapy-ontario)
- **\*-qa-comprehensive\* pages:** 3 (blocked by robots.txt, shouldn't be in sitemap)
- **Missing files:** 1 (professionals/workplace-burnout-therapy)

**Critical Issue Identified:**
- 61 out of 62 non-.html URLs in sitemap actually point to .html files
- Vercel's `cleanUrls: true` makes files accessible at BOTH `/page.html` AND `/page`
- This is splitting ranking signals across duplicate URLs
- Google doesn't know which version to rank

**Recommendation:**
- Keep .html as canonical format
- Remove 62 non-.html URLs from sitemap
- Remove 3 qa-comprehensive pages from sitemap
- Implement 301 redirects: non-.html ‚Üí .html (Day 2 task)

  - CRPO compliant (@type: "Person" instead of "Physician")
  - Includes provider with CRPO #10979

## üí° Lessons Learned

1. **Sitemap Audit Revealed Critical Issue:** The duplicate URL problem is worse than initially thought - almost ALL pages are accessible at two URLs due to Vercel's cleanUrls feature.

2. **Some Planned Pages Don't Exist:** acceptance-commitment-therapy-act.html was in ChatGPT's analysis but doesn't exist. Need to verify page existence before planning optimizations.

3. **Schema Validation is Critical:** The MedicalBusiness schema had 4+ invalid properties that were preventing rich results. Always validate schema changes.

4. **Title/Meta Improvements are Quick Wins:** These changes take <30 minutes per page and can yield immediate CTR improvements once Google recrawls.
