## 1. HERO SECTION IMAGE - PRIMARY CONVERSION DRIVER

### Purpose: 
Create immediate emotional safety while promising transformation without being overly optimistic.

### Detailed Prompt Version A (Abstract Path):
```
Photorealistic image, DSLR quality, 16:9 aspect ratio, shallow depth of field. 
A winding forest path in early morning with soft golden hour lighting filtering through trees, 
creating dappled shadows on the ground. The path curves gently out of view suggesting 
continuation and journey. Foreground shows moss-covered stones and small wildflowers in 
sage green and soft yellow. Background fades into soft bokeh with hints of warm sunlight. 
Color palette: dominant sage green (#8FA68E), warm golden highlights, soft browns of earth 
and bark. Atmosphere is hopeful but not overwhelmingly bright, peaceful but with gentle 
movement suggested by light breeze in leaves. Shot at eye level to feel approachable, 
not looking up or down. No people, no text, no artificial elements. Natural imperfections 
like fallen leaves add authenticity. Style reference: National Geographic nature photography 
meets wellness brand aesthetic, professional but not sterile, inviting but not saccharine.
```

### Detailed Prompt Version B (Abstract Water):
```
High-resolution photograph, professional camera quality, 16:9 widescreen format.
Aerial view of gentle ocean waves meeting a sandy shore at sunrise. The water is a 
soft blue-green (#6B9BD1 mixed with sage undertones), creating natural foam patterns 
that suggest breathing and rhythm. The sand shows natural ripple patterns from receding 
tide. Lighting is soft and diffused, early morning golden hour creating long, gentle 
shadows. The composition follows rule of thirds with the waterline creating a diagonal 
from lower left to upper right, suggesting forward movement. Color temperature warm 
but not orange, approximately 4500K. Subtle lens flare in upper corner adds warmth 
without distraction. The water movement is captured with slight motion blur (1/15 second 
exposure) to show flow and change. No people, footprints partially washed away to suggest 
others have walked this path but it's private now. Mood: contemplative, rhythmic, 
naturally therapeutic. Post-processing: slight desaturation for calming effect, enhanced 
but natural-looking contrast, film emulation for organic feel.

## 2. SERVICE CARD IMAGES - ENGAGEMENT DRIVERS

### 2.1 Anxiety & Stress Management
**Purpose**: Visual metaphor for finding calm within chaos

```
Digital illustration, vector art with watercolor texture overlay, square format 800x800px.
Central image: A clear glass sphere containing a perfectly still miniature zen garden with 
three smooth river stones stacked in balance, fine sand with circular rake patterns. The 
sphere floats in a soft-focus background suggesting gentle chaos - abstract brushstrokes 
in muted greys and light blues that swirl but don't overwhelm. Inside the sphere, the 
colors are warm sage green (#8FA68E) and sand beige, creating stark but gentle contrast 
with outside. Soft directional lighting from upper left creates subtle shadows under stones. 
The glass sphere has realistic refraction but remains mostly transparent. Small details: 
tiny succulent plant in corner of zen garden, single cherry blossom petal resting on top 
stone. Style: Modern minimalist meets Japanese aesthetics, clean but warm, structured but 
organic. Technical: 300 DPI, RGB color space, slight grain texture for warmth, white 
background with 10% opacity shadow beneath floating sphere for depth.
```

### 2.2 Men's Mental Health
**Purpose**: Strength without toxic masculinity, vulnerability as courage

```
Minimalist digital artwork, geometric style with organic elements, 800x800px square.
Composition: Interlocking geometric shapes - a strong triangle (navy #1e3e72) that opens 
at one corner, allowing a softer circular form (sage green #8FA68E) to partially emerge 
and overlap. The intersection creates a gradient blend suggesting integration. Background 
is clean white with subtle paper texture (2% opacity). The triangle has a slight wood grain 
texture within it (barely visible, 5% opacity) suggesting natural strength. The circle 
contains an abstract watercolor wash that bleeds slightly beyond its borders, showing 
controlled vulnerability. A thin gold line (#D4A574) traces where the shapes meet, 
highlighting connection point. Small detail: tiny door outline where triangle opens, 
suggesting choice and agency. Lighting: soft drop shadow (3px blur, 15% opacity) giving 
dimension without harshness. Style inspiration: Bauhaus meets contemporary wellness brands, 
architectural but human, structured but flexible. No text, no faces, no stereotypical 
masculine symbols.
```

### 2.3 Workplace Stress & Burnout
**Purpose**: Balance and growth despite pressure

```
Detailed vector illustration with photorealistic textures, 800x800px, centered composition.
Main element: An open laptop viewed from 45-degree angle, the screen showing a soft gradient 
from grey to sage green. Growing from the keyboard between the G and H keys is a healthy 
small bonsai tree, roots gently wrapping around keys without damaging them. The tree has 
detailed bark texture and tiny leaves in varying shades of green. Scattered on the desk 
surface: three coffee ring stains (suggesting long hours) but also a fresh cup of herbal 
tea with steam wisps. A sticky note with a simple hand-drawn smiley face. Natural daylight 
from left creates realistic shadows. The laptop is modern, minimalist design in space grey. 
Background is a soft-focus office environment, barely visible, suggesting work context 
without overwhelming. Details: One falling leaf from the bonsai is caught mid-air, showing 
natural cycle. The laptop trackpad reflects the tree slightly. Style: Photorealistic 
illustration meets metaphorical storytelling, professional but hopeful, acknowledging 
struggle while showing growth. Color palette: Muted greys, sage greens, warm wood brown 
for bonsai, soft yellow for sticky note.
```

### 2.4 Life Transitions & Change
**Purpose**: Movement and transformation as natural, not scary

```
Mixed media digital art, watercolor and geometric elements, 800x800px square format.
Central image: An origami butterfly mid-transformation, half still folded paper (showing 
creases and structure) and half becoming organic butterfly with detailed wing patterns. 
The paper portion is in soft grey with visible fold lines and slight shadows showing 
dimension. The organic portion shows wing details in sage green and soft blue gradient 
with delicate veining. The transformation point has small fragments/particles floating, 
suggesting active change. Background: Abstract watercolor wash transitioning from cool 
grey-blue on left to warm sage-gold on right, very soft and out of focus. Small details: 
Tiny golden dots (#D4A574) creating a path that the butterfly appears to be following. 
A few paper fragments below suggesting what's been left behind. Lighting: Soft backlight 
makes wing portions translucent. Style: Japanese paper art meets contemporary digital 
illustration, delicate but strong, structured but free. Technique: Layer blend modes 
to show transparency, subtle motion blur on floating particles, paper texture overlay 
on origami portion.
```

### 2.5 Depression & Mood Support
**Purpose**: Hope without toxic positivity, acknowledging darkness while showing possibility

```
Atmospheric digital painting, impressionist style with photographic elements, 800x800px.
Scene: A window view from inside looking out, the window frame creating natural division. 
Inside portion (bottom third) shows muted, darker tones - a windowsill in shadow with a 
small, slightly wilted plant beginning to show one new green shoot. Outside portion shows 
a soft-focus landscape with gentle rain clearing to reveal breaks of warm sunlight through 
clouds. The rain is visible but gentle, not stormy. Color transition: Interior uses deeper 
greys and muted blues, gradually warming to sage greens and soft golds in the distance. 
Key detail: Water droplets on window create natural prisms catching light, suggesting 
beauty in the difficulty. The window is slightly open (crack at bottom), allowing fresh 
air in. Reflection in glass shows faint outline of room interior - comfortable but lived-in. 
Style: Modern impressionism meets photorealism, emotional but not sentimental, honest but 
hopeful. Technique: Multiple exposure blend for depth, careful color grading for emotional 
progression, selective focus to guide eye toward light.
```

### 2.6 Relationship & Communication
**Purpose**: Connection without codependency, separate but together

```
Minimalist geometric illustration with organic elements, vector art, 800x800px square.
Design: Two speech bubbles that overlap to create a Venn diagram effect. Left bubble is 
sage green (#8FA68E), right is soft blue (#6B9BD1), overlap area creates a natural blend 
showing new color. Inside each bubble are abstract watercolor washes that remain mostly 
within boundaries but occasionally spill over edges (controlled chaos). The overlap area 
contains small golden dots that form a constellation pattern, suggesting new understanding 
created together. Bubbles have soft edges, not perfect geometric shapes - slightly organic 
and hand-drawn feeling. Small detail: Thin golden thread (#D4A574) connects the two bubbles 
at a second point, showing additional connection beyond the overlap. Background: Pure white 
with very subtle paper texture. Style: Scandinavian minimalism meets emotional intelligence 
visualization, clean but warm, simple but meaningful. Shadow: Very soft drop shadow to lift 
bubbles off background. No faces, no figures, purely abstract representation of communication.

## 3. TRUST & CREDIBILITY IMAGES

### Virtual Therapy Setup
**Purpose**: Show professional but accessible environment

```
Photorealistic rendering, interior photography style, 16:9 format, 1920x1080px minimum.
Scene: Corner of a lived-in but tidy home office/living space. Composition follows rule 
of thirds. Main elements: Modern laptop (13-inch, space grey) open on a simple wooden desk 
(oak or bamboo), screen showing abstract soft gradient (privacy). Beside laptop: A ceramic 
mug with herbal tea (visible steam), a closed journal with quality pen, small potted 
succulent. Background (soft focus): Built-in bookshelf with mix of books (spines not 
fully readable for privacy), one small framed abstract art piece, a comfortable reading 
chair partially visible. Lighting: Natural daylight from left, creating soft shadows, 
approximately 11am light quality - bright but not harsh. Important details: Power cord 
shows this is a permanent setup not temporary, small ring light attached to laptop 
(professional touch), comfort items like soft throw blanket visible on chair, one book 
slightly pulled out suggesting active use. Color palette: Warm wood tones, sage green 
accents, neutral greys and whites, one pop of warm coral (#E07A5F) in art piece. Style: 
Kinfolk magazine meets professional workspace, Instagram-worthy but authentic, aspirational 
but achievable. Technique: Shallow depth of field (f/2.8), slight vignetting for intimacy, 
color grading toward warm tones.
```

## 4. BACKGROUND TEXTURES & SUBTLE ELEMENTS

### Section Divider - Organic Wave
**Purpose**: Subtle separation between sections without harsh lines

```
Abstract vector pattern, seamless horizontal design, 1920x200px, scalable.
Design: Gentle wave pattern inspired by Japanese seigaiha (wave) motifs but simplified 
and modernized. Three overlapping wave lines in different opacities - back wave at 10% 
sage green, middle at 15%, front at 20%. Waves have slight texture within them suggesting 
watercolor paper. Mathematical precision in repetition but with small intentional 
imperfections (1-2px variations) to feel hand-drawn. The waves peak and valley gently, 
maximum height variation 40px. Where waves overlap, subtle color multiplication creates 
deeper green moments. Background: Pure white or 2% grey. Can be inverted for dark sections. 
Export specifications: SVG for scalability, PNG with transparency for easy implementation. 
Style: Modern Japanese minimalism, calm rhythm, professional but not corporate.
```

## 5. CALL-TO-ACTION BACKGROUNDS

### Booking Section Background
**Purpose**: Create urgency without anxiety

```
Subtle gradient with organic elements, 1920x600px, designed for text overlay.
Base: Linear gradient from white to 5% sage green (#8FA68E with 95% transparency), 
flowing from top to bottom. Overlay elements: Abstract watercolor shapes in very light 
opacity (3-5%) creating organic movement from left to right, suggesting forward momentum. 
One shape resembles an opening door, another suggests a path. Small particle effects: 
Tiny circles (2-3px) in golden color (#D4A574) at 10% opacity, scattered like dust motes 
in sunlight, concentrated more on right side (toward action). Subtle animation potential: 
Designed so particles could slowly drift if animated. Texture: Very subtle canvas/paper 
texture overlay at 2% to prevent flat digital feeling. The gradient is not perfectly 
linear - slight wave in the middle creating gentle visual interest. Important: All elements 
must remain subtle enough for black text to maintain WCAG AA compliance for accessibility.
