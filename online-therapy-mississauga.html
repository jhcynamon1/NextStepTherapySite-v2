Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) both show strong results for anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety, panic attacks, social anxiety, and health anxiety. Most people notice meaningful improvements within 8-12 sessions, though the timeline varies by individual. Therapy can't eliminate anxiety entirely—that's neither possible nor healthy—but it can help you change your relationship with anxiety so it doesn't control your choices or limit your life."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "The most evidence-based approaches are Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). CBT focuses on identifying and challenging anxious thoughts while gradually facing feared situations. ACT emphasizes accepting anxiety as part of being human while taking action based on your values rather than your fears. At Next Step Therapy, I primarily use ACT approaches, which research shows are particularly effective for chronic worry, panic attacks, and social anxiety. I'm also trained in mindfulness-based techniques and exposure therapy when appropriate. The best approach depends on your specific anxiety pattern and what resonates with you personally."

Most extended health benefit plans in Ontario cover psychotherapy services with a Registered Psychotherapist (CRPO), typically covering 50-100% of the session cost depending on your specific plan. Before your first session, check your benefits to understand your coverage limits. I provide detailed receipts that make it easy to submit claims to your insurance company. If you don't have insurance coverage, we can discuss frequency of sessions to make therapy financially sustainable—some clients prefer biweekly sessions rather than weekly, for example."

As a Registered Psychotherapist with the College of Registered Psychotherapists of Ontario (CRPO #10979), I'm legally and ethically bound to protect your privacy. What you discuss in therapy stays between us with very limited exceptions: if there's imminent risk of harm to yourself or others, or if there's disclosure of child abuse. If you're using insurance benefits, your provider knows you're seeing a mental health professional but receives no details about what we discuss—only the date of service and fee. Virtual therapy platforms I use are encrypted and meet Canadian healthcare privacy standards."

I'll ask about what brings you to therapy right now, how you're feeling (physical symptoms, thoughts, behaviors), what triggers challenges, and how they're affecting your daily life, relationships, and work. We'll also discuss your goals—what would be different if therapy helped? You'll have plenty of opportunities to ask questions about the process, my approach, and what to expect. There's no pressure to share anything you're not comfortable with, and many people find that just talking in a non-judgmental space provides some relief. The first session is as much about seeing if we're a good fit as it is about gathering information."

            "text": "Most people start noticing some shifts within the first 4-6 sessions—perhaps challenges feel slightly less overwhelming, or you're able to use a technique when stress starts to build. Meaningful, sustained change typically happens over 8-16 weeks of regular sessions (weekly or biweekly). That said, timelines vary significantly based on how long you've struggled, the severity of symptoms, and how much you're able to practice strategies between sessions. Some people feel substantially better after a few months and then check in occasionally for tune-ups, while others prefer longer-term support. We'll regularly assess your progress together and adjust the frequency of sessions based on what's working."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Yes, therapy is highly effective for both panic attacks and social anxiety. For panic attacks, we work on understanding your body's alarm system, developing grounding techniques to use during panic, and gradually reducing the fear of panic itself (which often makes panic worse). For social anxiety, we focus on challenging thoughts about judgment and rejection, practicing self-compassion, and gradually building tolerance for social discomfort through behavioral experiments. ACT therapy is particularly helpful for both because it teaches you to take valued action (attending the work event, speaking up in meetings) even when anxiety is present, rather than waiting for anxiety to disappear first."

Some extended health insurance plans require a referral for coverage, so check your specific plan details, but most don't. If your plan does require one, your family doctor can provide a simple referral letter. The advantage of working with a Registered Psychotherapist (versus waiting for publicly funded services) is that you can typically start within days rather than waiting months, and you have more control over scheduling and frequency of sessions."

Virtual therapy has been shown to be just as effective as in-person therapy for anxiety disorders, with the added benefits of convenience and reduced stress from commuting. Many Mississauga residents appreciate being able to have therapy sessions from their home without adding a trip to their already busy schedule. You can join sessions from anywhere you have privacy—your home office, bedroom, or even your parked car during a lunch break if needed. All you need is a computer, tablet, or smartphone with internet access and a private space where you can talk freely. Virtual sessions also eliminate the stress some people feel about being seen entering or leaving a therapist's office."

Check their credentials—in Ontario, Registered Psychotherapist (RP) with CRPO registration ensures they meet professional standards. Beyond credentials, fit matters enormously: Do they explain things in ways that make sense to you? Do you feel comfortable being honest with them? Do they seem to understand your specific life circumstances (like the unique pressures of Mississauga suburban life)? The free 15-minute consultation is designed to help you assess this fit before committing. Trust your instincts—if something feels off during that initial conversation, it's completely appropriate to keep looking for someone who feels like a better match."

Many of my clients take anti-anxiety or antidepressant medication while also doing therapy, and we coordinate with their prescribing doctor when helpful. If you're considering medication or already taking it, we can discuss how therapy fits with your medication plan. Some people use medication short-term while developing therapy skills, others prefer long-term medication alongside occasional therapy sessions, and many find therapy alone is sufficient. It's a personal decision best made in collaboration with both your doctor and therapist."

            "text": "Consider seeking therapy if stress, anxiety, or other challenges are affecting your daily functioning, relationships, work performance, or quality of life. Specific signs include: avoiding situations or activities you used to enjoy, difficulty sleeping due to worry, physical symptoms like chest tightness or racing heart that interfere with your day, canceling plans frequently, relationships suffering because you're irritable or withdrawn, work performance declining because you're distracted, or using alcohol or other substances to cope. You don't need to wait until things reach a crisis point—early intervention often prevents more significant difficulties later. If you're wondering whether your situation is bad enough for therapy, that question itself suggests it might be worth exploring professional support."
