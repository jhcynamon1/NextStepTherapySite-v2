                        <p>I take a collaborative approach to therapy. Each session is tailored to your specific needs - no cookie-cutter programs or generic worksheets.</p>
                        <p>We'll explore the gap between where you are and where you want to be. I use approaches that research supports, while prioritizing the therapeutic relationship - because that's what research says matters most.</p>
                        <p>My goal is to help you develop awareness of your patterns and make sense of what's happening. From there, we figure out what's in your control.</p>
                        <p>Most clients meet weekly or biweekly, depending on their needs and schedule.</p>
