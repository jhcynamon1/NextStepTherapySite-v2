## üîç CRITICAL BUSINESS ASSESSMENT REQUEST

**Manus, we need your honest, objective evaluation before we fully commit to this strategy:**

### **1. VIABILITY ASSESSMENT**
- **Success Probability:** What's the realistic likelihood this rank-and-rent model succeeds long-term?
- **Market Saturation Risk:** How quickly will this opportunity disappear as competition enters?
- **Sustainability:** Can this model work for 3-5 years, or is it a short-term arbitrage play?

### **2. THERAPIST ADOPTION REALITY CHECK**
- **Payment Willingness:** Will private practice therapists actually pay $200-281/month for leads?
- **Trust Factor:** How do we overcome skepticism from clinicians about "marketing companies"?
- **Value Perception:** Do therapists understand digital marketing ROI well enough to see the value?
- **Competitive Landscape:** Are they already using Psychology Today, Google Ads, or other lead sources?

### **3. PROVEN BUSINESS MODEL VALIDATION**
- **Industry Precedents:** Are there successful rank-and-rent operations in healthcare/therapy space?
- **Legal/Regulatory Risks:** Any CRPO or healthcare advertising restrictions we should know about?
- **Scalability Evidence:** Have you seen similar models scale beyond 5-10 sites successfully?

### **4. REALISTIC REVENUE PROJECTIONS - CANADA-WIDE**

**Conservative Scenario (Your Honest Assessment):**
- Year 1: _____ sites x $_____ average monthly rent = $_____ monthly recurring revenue
- Year 2: _____ sites x $_____ average monthly rent = $_____ monthly recurring revenue
- Year 3: _____ sites x $_____ average monthly rent = $_____ monthly recurring revenue

**Optimistic Scenario (If everything goes right):**
- Year 1: _____ sites x $_____ average monthly rent = $_____ monthly recurring revenue
- Year 2: _____ sites x $_____ average monthly rent = $_____ monthly recurring revenue
- Year 3: _____ sites x $_____ average monthly rent = $_____ monthly recurring revenue

**Key Assumptions to Challenge:**
- Average monthly rent per site: $200-281 realistic?
- Site development cost and timeline per site: $_____ and _____ weeks?
- Success rate: What % of sites will actually generate profitable rent?
- Churn rate: What % of therapists will cancel each year?

### **5. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE ASSESSMENT**
- **Barrier to Entry:** How easily can competitors replicate this model?
- **First Mover Advantage:** How much runway do we have before market saturation?
- **Defensibility:** What prevents therapists from building their own sites after learning from us?

### **6. RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS REALITY**
- **Time Investment:** Hours per week to manage 10 sites? 25 sites? 50 sites?
- **Capital Requirements:** Realistic budget needed to scale to 25 sites across Canada?
- **Team Scaling:** When do we need to hire, and what roles?

### **7. RISK FACTORS TO CONSIDER**
- **Google Algorithm Changes:** How vulnerable is this model to SEO updates?
- **Economic Downturn:** How recession-proof is therapy marketing spend?
- **Regulatory Changes:** Could CRPO or provincial regulations kill this model?
