# Manus AI Follow-Up: PPC vs Flat Fee Pricing Analysis

## Critical Pricing Model Reconsideration

After reviewing your initial monetization analysis, we need to reconsider the fundamental pricing model. Your analysis recommended flat monthly fees ($99-$249/month), but we believe pay-per-click (PPC) pricing may be more compliant, attractive to therapists, and profitable. Please conduct a comprehensive analysis of PPC vs flat fee pricing using real market data and financial modeling.

## Regulatory Compliance Clarification Needed

**CRPO Regulation Analysis:**
- Is pay-per-click advertising actually prohibited by CRPO, or just referral fees tied to therapy sessions?
- How is PPC different from Google Ads (which therapists currently use legally)?
- What's the distinction between "marketing services" (selling clicks) vs "referral services" (sending specific clients)?
- Are there any CRPO precedents or rulings on PPC advertising for therapy practices?

**Research Request:** Find specific CRPO documentation, case studies, or legal precedents that clarify whether PPC advertising constitutes prohibited "referral fees" or permissible "marketing services."

## Real Market Data Analysis Required

## Critical Billing Definition Analysis

### How Should a Billable Click Be Defined?
This is fundamental to CPC valuation, fraud controls, conversion expectations, and compliance positioning. Research and recommend the optimal billing definition:

**Option 1: Outbound Click to Therapist Website/Profile**
- Pros: Simple tracking, clear intent signal, industry standard
- Cons: May include low-quality traffic, harder to prove value
- Compliance: Clearly marketing service, not referral-based
- Technical: Easy to implement with standard analytics

**Option 2: Click-to-Call or Tap-to-Reveal Phone/Email**
- Pros: Higher intent signal, direct contact initiation
- Cons: Mobile-heavy, may miss desktop users
- Compliance: Still marketing service, contact facilitation
- Technical: Requires phone tracking and reveal mechanisms

**Option 3: In-Platform Message or Booking Click**
- Pros: Highest intent, contained within platform
- Cons: Requires building messaging/booking system
- Compliance: Platform-mediated contact, clear marketing service
- Technical: Complex development, user account management

**Option 4: Any Outbound Contact-Intent Event (All Above)**
- Pros: Captures all engagement types, maximizes billable events
- Cons: May include lower-quality interactions
- Compliance: Broad definition may blur marketing/referral lines
- Technical: Multiple tracking systems required

**Option 5: Only Qualified Clicks After Bot/Fraud Filtering**
- Pros: Highest quality, fraud protection, therapist confidence
- Cons: Complex filtering, potential disputes over qualification
