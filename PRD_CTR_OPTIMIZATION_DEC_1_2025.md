# PRD: CTR Optimization Phase 2 - December 1, 2025

**Status:** üìã DRAFT - Ready for Dec 1 Implementation
**Created:** October 29, 2025
**Deploy Date:** December 1, 2025 (after 30-day stability)
**Owner:** Jesse Cynamon
**Goal:** Increase average CTR from 1.02% ‚Üí 3-5% within 30 days

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

### The Problem:
- **Current CTR:** 1.02% site average (some pages as low as 0.09%)
- **Industry benchmark:** 3-5% for therapy websites
- **Impressions growing:** 250K/month but getting wasted
- **Math:** At 1% CTR with 250K impressions = 2,500 clicks. At 4% CTR = 10,000 clicks (4x traffic!)

### The Solution:
Transform boring keyword-stuffed title tags into emotional hooks that:
1. ‚úÖ Maintain keyword rankings (via H1 + body content)
2. ‚úÖ 3-5x the click-through rate (emotional connection)
3. ‚úÖ Stay CRPO compliant (no guarantees/promises)
4. ‚úÖ Match user search intent (problem-aware language)

### The Strategy:
- **Test on 5 high-impression pages** (Dec 1-31)
- **Measure CTR impact** (expect 1% ‚Üí 3-5%)
- **If successful, roll out to all pages** (Jan 2026)
- **If flat, iterate messaging** (A/B test variations)

## üìä Test Pages Selection (Top 5 by Impressions)

Based on GSC data (Aug-Oct 2025):

| Page | Current Impressions | Current CTR | Current Clicks | Target CTR | Target Clicks | Potential Gain |
|------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| virtual-therapy-ontario.html | 1,053 | 0.09% | 1 | 3.5% | 37 | +36 clicks/mo |
| anxiety-therapy-burlington.html | 674 | 0.15% | 1 | 4.0% | 27 | +26 clicks/mo |
| therapist-toronto.html | 391 | 0% | 0 | 3.5% | 14 | +14 clicks/mo |
| anxiety-therapy-ontario.html | ~300 | 1.0% | 3 | 4.5% | 14 | +11 clicks/mo |
| workplace-stress-therapy-ontario.html | ~250 | 0.8% | 2 | 4.0% | 10 | +8 clicks/mo |
| **TOTAL** | **2,668** | **0.26%** | **7** | **3.9%** | **102** | **+95 clicks/mo** |

**Projected Impact:** 7 clicks/month ‚Üí 102 clicks/month = **14.5x increase** if we hit target CTR.

## üîÑ The Title Tag Formula

### OLD Formula (Keyword-Stuffed, Boring):
```
[Keyword] + [Location] + [Credential] + [Feature]
Example: "Virtual Therapy Ontario | CRPO Therapist ‚Ä¢ Same-Week Appointments"
```

**Why it fails:**
- No emotional connection
- Reads like every competitor
- Doesn't acknowledge user's pain
- Boring, clinical, forgettable

### NEW Formula (Emotional Hook + Keyword):
```
[Emotional Hook That Names The Pain] + [Keyword for Clarity] + [Location]
Example: "Can't Face Another Office Visit? Virtual Therapy That Meets You Where You Are | Ontario"
```

**Why it works:**
- Names the specific pain (avoiding office visits)
- Creates emotional resonance ("meets you where you are")
- Still includes keyword for rankings
- CRPO compliant (no guarantees)
- Memorable and clickable

**Bad:** "Evidence-based therapeutic interventions"
**Good:** "Therapy that actually makes sense"

### 3. Be Hyper-Specific
**Bad:** "Feel better with our help"
**Good:** "Stop googling symptoms at 3am"

### 4. Avoid Therapeutic Jargon
**Bad:** "Cognitive behavioral techniques for anxiety reduction"
**Good:** "Tools to quiet the worry spiral"

### 5. CRPO Compliance Rules
- ‚úÖ NO outcome guarantees ("get rid of anxiety forever")
- ‚úÖ NO superlative claims ("best therapist in Ontario")
- ‚úÖ NO time-bound promises ("anxiety-free in 6 weeks")
- ‚úÖ YES exploratory language ("let's explore," "see if we're a fit")
- ‚úÖ YES descriptive accuracy ("CRPO-registered," "specializing in")

**Likelihood:** Low
**Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- H1 tags remain keyword-focused

### Risk 2: CTR Doesn't Improve
**Likelihood:** Low-Medium
**Impact:** Low (no harm done, just wasted effort)
**Mitigation:**
- Titles are based on proven psychology patterns
- Manus research validated emotional hooks work
- Test pages are high-impression (statistically significant)

**Contingency:**
If CTR doesn't improve after 30 days:

- Test more aggressive emotional hooks
- Try different pain points
- A/B test multiple variations per page

**Likelihood:** Very Low
**Impact:** Very High (license suspension risk)
**Mitigation:**
- All titles reviewed against CRPO guidelines
- No outcome guarantees
- No superlative claims
- No time-bound promises
- Exploratory/descriptive language only

**Contingency:**
If CRPO flags a title:
- Immediate revert
- Document the issue
- Consult CRPO directly before rewording

### Risk 4: Impressions Drop (Lost Visibility)
**Likelihood:** Low
**Impact:** High
**Mitigation:**
- Primary keywords still in title
- H1 unchanged
- Body content unchanged

**Contingency:**
If impressions drop >20%:
- Check GSC for specific query drops
- Revert to original titles immediately
- Analyze which queries lost visibility

## üéì Decision Framework: Choosing Options A/B/C

For each page, choose based on:

### 1. User Intent Match
**Question:** What is the searcher's primary pain point?
- Work stress? ‚Üí Choose professional/burnout angle
- Accessibility? ‚Üí Choose location/convenience angle
- Cost? ‚Üí Choose affordability angle

### 2. Differentiation from Competitors
**Question:** What are other Toronto/Ontario therapists saying?
- If everyone says "CRPO registered," don't lead with credentials
- If everyone says "evidence-based," lean into human connection
- Find the gap in competitor messaging

### 3. CRPO Safety
**Question:** Could this be interpreted as a guarantee?
- "Get rid of anxiety" ‚Üí NO ‚ùå
- "Finally feel better" ‚Üí Borderline ‚ö†Ô∏è
- "Let's work on anxiety together" ‚Üí YES ‚úÖ

### 4. Specificity Test
**Question:** Could this title apply to 100 other therapy practices?
- "Professional Therapy Services" ‚Üí TOO GENERIC ‚ùå
- "Therapy for Toronto Professionals" ‚Üí GENERIC ‚ùå
- "Stop Googling Symptoms at 3am" ‚Üí SPECIFIC ‚úÖ

### 5. Personal Gut Check
**Question:** If I saw this in Google at 3am, would I click?
- Be honest
- Test with real humans if possible
- Read it out loud‚Äîdoes it sound natural?
