### **2. NEW SECTION: Immediate Action Plan** (MindBeacon Pattern)

**Add before "Getting Started" section:**

<!-- What To Do Tonight Section (NEW) -->
<section class="section alternate-bg">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="content-grid">
            <h2 class="section-title centered">What To Do Tonight If You're Failing</h2>

            <p class="section-intro">Overwhelming anxiety makes it hard to think clearly. Here's a concrete action plan you can follow right now:</p>

            <div class="action-timeline">
                <div class="action-item urgent">
                    <h4>Tonight (Next 2 Hours)</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Step away from your desk:</strong> Anxiety spikes when you force yourself to study while panicking. Take a 30-minute break to reset.</li>
                        <li><strong>Write down your specific fears:</strong> "I'm going to fail this course." "My parents will be disappointed." Getting fears out of your head and onto paper reduces their power.</li>
                        <li><strong>Identify ONE small action:</strong> Not "fix everything"‚Äîjust one manageable step. Email a professor. Text a friend. Google "academic advisor + [your university]."</li>
                        <li><strong>Basic self-care:</strong> Eat something, drink water, consider going to bed instead of panic-studying until 3 AM.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                        <li><strong>Contact your academic advisor:</strong> Most have same-day availability for students in crisis. They've seen this before and know how to help.</li>
                        <li><strong>Email professors about current assignments:</strong> Brief, honest, professional. Explain you're struggling and seeking support.</li>
                        <li><strong>Call your university counseling center:</strong> Many offer same-day crisis appointments or can triage your urgency level.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tell ONE trusted person:</strong> Friend, family member, RA‚Äîsomeone who can provide emotional support while you navigate this.</li>

                        <li><strong>Create a realistic study schedule:</strong> Not a "catch up on everything" marathon. Small, daily progress with built-in breaks.</li>

                        <li><strong>Academic skills development:</strong> Learn how YOU learn best. High school strategies often don't work in university.</li>
