                            <p>That sinking feeling that starts around 3 PM every Sunday. Your brain begins cataloging everything that could go wrong in the upcoming week, and before you know it, you've mentally catastrophized through Thursday.</p>

                            <p>Many Ontarians develop anxiety because they've learned to equate self-worth with productivity and achievement. When success becomes your only source of security, every challenge feels like a threat to your identity.</p>

                    <p class="section-intro">Anxiety therapy isn't about eliminating worried thoughts—it's about changing your relationship with them. Instead of spending your energy trying to control anxiety, you learn to move forward with important goals even when anxious feelings are present.</p>

                            <h4>Learning to Observe Rather Than Obey</h4>
                            <p>You'll develop skills to notice anxious thoughts without automatically believing or acting on them. This creates space between you and your anxiety, allowing for more thoughtful responses to challenging situations.</p>

                            <p>Much of anxiety comes from trying to control outcomes that are ultimately uncertain. We'll work on building your capacity to take meaningful action even when you can't guarantee specific results.</p>

                            <p>You'll learn evidence-based techniques for managing physical anxiety symptoms, redirecting worried thinking, and staying grounded during overwhelming moments. These aren't abstract concepts—they're tools you can use immediately.</p>

                            <p>Anxiety often makes us focus on avoiding discomfort rather than pursuing what matters. We'll help you reconnect with your values and take steps toward important goals, even when anxiety tries to hold you back.</p>

                    <p>This approach, based primarily on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), has strong research support for anxiety disorders. It's particularly effective for people who are tired of fighting their thoughts and want to learn how to live well alongside whatever mental experiences arise.</p>

                        <h3>Your First Sessions</h3>
                        <p>We'll start by understanding your specific experience of anxiety—how it shows up, what triggers it, and how it's affecting your daily life. Rather than diving into your entire life history, we focus on what's happening now and what you want to change.</p>

                        <h4>We'll explore:</h4>
                        <ul class="feature-list">

                            <li>What you've already tried and what's been helpful (or not)</li>
                            <li>Your goals for therapy and what "better" would look like for you</li>
                            <li>Immediate strategies you can start using between sessions</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Building Skills and Taking Action</h3>
                        <p>Each session includes practical elements you can apply in your daily life. You're not just talking about anxiety—you're building a comprehensive toolkit for managing it in real-world situations.</p>

                        <h4>You'll learn to:</h4>
                        <ul class="feature-list">
                            <li>Recognize anxiety patterns before they spiral out of control</li>
                            <li>Use breathing and grounding techniques that actually work</li>
                            <li>Challenge catastrophic thinking without dismissing legitimate concerns</li>

                        <p>When anxiety has led to avoidance, we'll work together to gradually and safely help you re-engage with situations you've been avoiding. This process is always at your pace and builds genuine confidence through experience.</p>
