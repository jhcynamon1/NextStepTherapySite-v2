I understand Ontario's diverse communities and the specific challenges each brings—from Toronto's competitive job market to Northern Ontario's geographic isolation, from university pressures in London to suburban stress in Mississauga.</p>

Whether it's worrying about layoffs in the tech sector, housing affordability, or your kids' futures, GAD makes everything feel urgent and overwhelming. We'll work on breaking the worry cycle while building tolerance for uncertainty—essential skills for navigating Ontario's unpredictable economy and rapid changes.</p>

In Ontario's diverse communities, social anxiety can be compounded by cultural expectations, language barriers, or feeling like an outsider. Together, we'll build authentic confidence for real-world situations.</p>

Using ACT and exposure techniques, we'll help you reclaim the places and activities that panic has taken from you.</p>

From imposter syndrome to presentation panic, we'll develop strategies that work in high-pressure professional environments.</p>

                        <p>Anxiety therapy isn't about eliminating all anxious feelings—it's about changing your relationship with anxiety so it no longer controls your life. Here's how we'll work together:</p>

                            <p>We'll explore how anxiety shows up in your life, what triggers it, and how it's affecting your relationships, work, and daily activities. This isn't about judgment—it's about understanding.</p>
