    <h2 id="signs">Signs You Might Be Experiencing University Anxiety</h2>
    <p>University life comes with late nights, unpredictable schedules, and nonstop evaluation. Anxiety shows up in different ways for every student. Some warning signs include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Difficulty turning off academic thoughts, even when you try to rest.</li>
      <li>Physical symptoms before class or exams: racing heart, stomach pain, or shortness of breath.</li>
      <li>Avoiding classes, labs, or emails because you fear making mistakes.</li>
      <li>Comparing yourself harshly with peers and feeling like an imposter.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Therapy offers a confidential space to unpack these patterns, learn new coping skills, and develop habits that support long-term momentum.</p>
