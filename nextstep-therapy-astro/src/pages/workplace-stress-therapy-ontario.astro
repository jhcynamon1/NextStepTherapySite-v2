But the exhaustion feels the same.</p>

                            <p>Work doesn't end when you leave the office anymore. Your brain stays engaged with tomorrow's deadlines, last week's meeting, and next month's project. Even vacation feels like borrowed time that you'll pay for later.</p>

                            <p>You've achieved what you thought you wantedâ€”the title, the salary, the recognitionâ€”but instead of satisfaction, you feel trapped. More responsibility means more stress, and "success" starts feeling like a prison.</p>

                    <p class="section-intro">Workplace stress often develops when there's a mismatch between job demands and available resourcesâ€”whether that's time, support, autonomy, or clarity about expectations. In Ontario's competitive, fast-paced work environment, this mismatch has become the norm rather than the exception.</p>

                    <div class="card-grid">
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4>Ontario's Work Culture Realities</h4>
                            <p>From Toronto's "always-on" startup culture to the bureaucratic pressures of Ottawa's government sector, Ontario workplaces often reward overwork and normalize stress. What feels like personal failure is often a predictable response to unsustainable systems.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4>The Achiever's Dilemma</h4>
                            <p>High performers often become victims of their own competence. You deliver excellent work, so you get more work. You handle pressure well, so you get more pressure. Success breeds expectation, and expectation can breed burnout.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4>Economic Pressures and Job Security</h4>
                            <p>Ontario's housing costs, family financial pressures, and economic uncertainty create a context where saying "no" at work feels risky. When your livelihood feels precarious, boundaries feel like luxuries you can't afford.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4>Technology and Boundary Erosion</h4>
                            <p>Smartphones and remote work capabilities have dissolved the traditional boundaries between work and life. "Urgent" emails at 9 PM and weekend Slack messages create a sense that work never really ends.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>Understanding these factors isn't about making excusesâ€”it's about recognizing that workplace stress often results from systemic issues, not personal shortcomings. This perspective opens up possibilities for change that go beyond just "working harder" or "being more resilient."</p>
