                            <p>You used to love your work in government, tech, or healthcare. Now Sunday evenings feel heavy, and Monday mornings require significant effort just to get started. Your career achievements feel hollow.</p>

                            <p>Success in Ottawa's competitive professional landscape often requires sacrificing personal values for external validation. When your daily actions don't align with what you actually care about, depression can emerge as your mind's way of saying "something needs to change."</p>

                            <p>Many Ottawa professionals find themselves in roles where they're expected to "have it all figured out." This creates isolation—you can't show vulnerability at work, but carrying that weight alone becomes unsustainable.</p>

                            <p>Ottawa's long winters, combined with the political pressure of being in the nation's capital, create unique challenges. The shortened daylight and high-stress environment can contribute to depression, especially for those already feeling disconnected.</p>

                    <p class="section-intro">It's normal to have questions before starting therapy for depression. Here are answers to some common concerns.</p>

                    <div class="faq-grid">
                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>"I'm still functioning at work. Is my depression 'bad enough' for therapy?"</h4>
                            <p><strong>High-functioning depression is real.</strong> Many successful professionals manage to maintain their performance while struggling internally. You don't have to wait for a crisis to seek support. Therapy can help you move from just 'functioning' to truly 'thriving'.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>"Will we just talk about my past?"</h4>
                            <p><strong>Our focus is on the present and future.</strong> While your history is important, our primary focus will be on the practical skills you can learn and actions you can take right now to improve your life, aligned with the future you want to create.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>"How is ACT different from other therapies for depression?"</h4>
                            <p><strong>It's about action, not just analysis.</strong> Instead of trying to avoid negative thoughts, ACT teaches you to change your relationship with them. It helps you take meaningful, values-driven action even when feelings of depression are present, which is a powerful way to break the cycle.</p>
                        </div>
