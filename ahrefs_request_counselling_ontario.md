## STEP 2: Data to Capture (For Each Keyword)

- ✅ **Traffic Potential** (if shown)
- ✅ **Parent Topic** (what broader topic does this belong to?)

### Also Check:

- **"Also rank for" tab** - Related keywords we could target on same page
- **"Matching terms"** - Variations and long-tail opportunities

## STEP 3: Key Questions to Answer:

1. **Which spelling dominates?**
   - counselling (British) vs counseling (American)
   - Which has higher search volume in Canada?

2. **Is there a bigger market?**
   - Does "therapy ontario" have 10x more volume than "counselling ontario"?
   - Should we pivot to broader keyword like we did with student anxiety?

3. **Competition level:**
   - What's the KD for "counselling ontario"?
   - Are there easier (lower KD) variations with good volume?

4. **Related opportunities:**
   - What related keywords show up in "Also rank for"?
   - Could we capture multiple keywords on one page?

## STEP 4: Screenshot Guidelines

Take screenshots of:

1. **Main keyword overview** for "counselling ontario" (volume, KD, traffic potential)
2. **Main keyword overview** for "counseling ontario" (compare spellings)
3. **Questions tab** (top 10 high-volume questions)
4. **Matching terms** (related keyword opportunities)

## WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR:

Based on our previous success with "student anxiety" optimization:

### Best Case Scenario:
- Ahrefs shows "counselling ontario" = 500-1,000 searches
- We discover "therapy ontario" = 5,000+ searches (10x larger market!)
- Strategic pivot: Target both on same page (hybrid approach)

### Good Case Scenario:
- "counselling ontario" = 800-2,000 searches (solid volume)
- Low-medium KD (15-35) = achievable ranking
- Multiple related keywords we can capture

### Warning Signs:
- Volume shows 0-10 searches (like "first year university anxiety" did - then GSC contradicted it!)
- Extremely high KD (60+) = very competitive
- No related keyword opportunities

---

## EXPECTED OUTCOME:

After reviewing Ahrefs data + Perplexity research, we'll decide:

1. **Primary keyword target** (counselling vs therapy vs psychotherapy)
2. **Spelling strategy** (British vs American or both)
3. **Hybrid vs focused** (broad "counselling" or niche "anxiety counselling")
4. **Title/meta/H1 optimization** based on keyword volume data
5. **Revenue potential** calculation

---

## REMEMBER:

**Ahrefs can be wrong!**
- "first year university anxiety" showed 0-10 searches in Ahrefs
- But GSC showed 70 actual impressions
- Always cross-validate with GSC data (we have 83 impressions for counselling-ontario.html)

The 83 impressions in GSC prove there IS search demand for this page - we just need to find the right keyword angles!
