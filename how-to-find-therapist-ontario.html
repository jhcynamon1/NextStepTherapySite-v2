                        <h3>Understand Credentials</h3>
                        <p>In Ontario, four regulated professions can provide psychotherapy: CRPO-registered psychotherapists (RPs), psychologists, social workers (RSWs), and psychiatrists. Review what each credential means, who regulates them, and which services align with your goals.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use the <a href="https://www.crpo.ca/find-a-registered-psychotherapist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CRPO public register</a> to verify psychotherapists.</li>
                            <li>Check the Ontario College of Social Workers for RSWs and the College of Psychologists for psychologists.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step-card" id="step-2">
                        <span class="step-number">2</span>
                        <h3>Clarify Your Goals</h3>
                        <p>Write down the concerns you want help with, how they’re affecting daily life, and any preferences (virtual vs. in-person, evening availability, modality, cultural or language considerations). This makes filtering easier and gives therapists context during consultations.</p>

                        <h3>Build a Shortlist</h3>
                        <p>Gather 3–5 potential therapists using vetted Ontario directories (see toolkit below). Save profiles that match your credentials, modality, and availability requirements. Note how quickly each therapist is booking new clients.</p>
                        <p>Add at least one option that offers a free consultation so you can compare experiences.</p>

                        <h3>Confirm Insurance & Budget</h3>
                        <p>Before booking, check your benefits: annual maximums, per-session caps, coinsurance, and whether a doctor's referral is required. If you have an Employee Assistance Program, schedule those sessions first and ask about continuity of care afterwards.</p>
                        <p>Use the insurance section below to cover OHIP, EAP, student plans, and sliding-scale options.</p>

                        <h3>Book Consultations</h3>
                        <p>Schedule short consults and come prepared with key questions: Have you treated concerns like mine? What approaches do you use? How do you structure sessions? What does availability look like? Do you provide insurance-ready receipts?</p>
                        <p>Notice how comfortable you feel talking with each therapist. Fit is critical for progress.</p>

                        <p>Complete intake forms, confirm technology for virtual sessions, and jot down top goals. Plan a few quiet minutes before and after to get the most from the appointment.</p>

                        <h3>Employee Assistance Programs (EAP)</h3>
                        <p>EAPs offer 3–8 prepaid sessions via providers such as LifeWorks or Inkblot. Ask how to transition to ongoing care once sessions are used, and whether the EAP can refer back to your chosen therapist.</p>

                        <p>Some therapists reserve slots for reduced-fee clients or offer packages. If cost is a barrier, ask about payment plans, use sliding-scale directories, or combine therapy with self-paced resources between sessions.</p>

                        <h3>How long should I stay with a therapist?</h3>
                        <p>Many people notice meaningful change after 8–12 sessions, but timelines depend on goals and frequency. Reassess fit every few months and be transparent with your therapist about progress—they’ll help you adjust cadence or plan a wrap-up when you’re ready.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can I switch therapists if it isn’t working?</h3>
                        <p>Absolutely. You’re hiring a professional—in Ontario you have the right to transfer care, request your records, or ask for referrals. It’s common to try more than one therapist before finding the right fit.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Do I need a doctor’s referral?</h3>
                        <p>No referral is needed to see a CRPO-registered psychotherapist or social worker. Some insurance plans request physician forms—always check your benefits booklet so you can get paperwork in place before the first claim.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What happens during the first session?</h3>
                        <p>Your therapist will review confidentiality, gather background information, explore your goals, and map out an initial plan. Expect a collaborative conversation—not an interrogation. Bring questions and any concerns about logistics, homework, or communication.</p>
