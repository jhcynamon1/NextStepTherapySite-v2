## Drowning in Tabs, Zoom Calls, and "Are You Still There?" Messages?

You're refreshing Slack every 3 minutes to prove you're working.
Your laptop's in the living room, the kitchen, and yes—even your bedroom.
Your screen time report says 14 hours, and that's just your work computer.

Remote work promised freedom. So why do you feel more trapped than ever?

Sound familiar? You're not failing at remote work. Remote work is failing you.
```

#### **4. Solution Promise Section (SolutionFirst Pattern)**

```markdown
## Imagine Therapy That Actually Gets Remote Work

What if you could:
- Close your laptop at 5 PM—and actually STOP thinking about work
- Have video calls that don't leave you drained for 2 hours afterward
- Feel connected without being "on" for 12 hours a day
- Set boundaries that your manager respects (and you actually maintain)
- Work from home without your home becoming your prison

That's what therapy for remote workers looks like at Next Step Therapy.

No generic workplace advice from a therapist who last worked in an office in 2019.
Just evidence-based strategies specifically for Zoom fatigue, boundary blur,
isolation paradoxes, and the unique mental gymnastics of work-from-home life.
