 You've built a life that looks great on paper. The house in Glen Abbey. The career. Maybe the kids are in good schools. But inside, your brain never stops. Every decision feels loaded. Every quiet moment gets filled with worry about what's next, what could go wrong, what you might be missing.

 <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-navy text-center mb-10">How Anxiety Therapy Actually Helps</h2>

 <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-navy/80">
 <p>
 Therapy isn't about fixing you. You're not broken. It's about understanding what's driving the anxiety and developing a different relationship with it.
 </p>

 <p>
 Here's what I've seen in my work with clients from Oakville and across the GTA: the anxiety usually makes sense. There are real pressures. Real responsibilities. Real stakes. The problem isn't that you worry. The problem is that the worry has taken over, and you've lost the ability to step back from it.
 </p>

 <p>
 I use Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), which is an evidence-based approach. But that's just the framework. What actually matters is whether we connect, whether you feel understood, and whether our conversations help you see things differently.
 </p>

 <p>
 This is about having real conversations about what's actually going on in your life and what you want it to look like instead. Practical, personalized, focused on what works for you.
 </p>

 <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy mt-8 mb-4">What we typically work on:</h3>

 <ul class="space-y-3">
 <li>Understanding why your anxiety shows up when and how it does</li>
 <li>Developing awareness without judgment (harder than it sounds)</li>
 <li>Getting clear on what you actually value, not just what you "should" do</li>
 <li>Building flexibility in how you respond to stress</li>
 <li>Learning to be present instead of always three steps ahead</li>
 </ul>

 <p class="mt-6">
 The goal isn't to eliminate anxiety. That's not realistic. The goal is to stop letting it run your life.

 <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-navy text-center mb-10">Virtual Therapy That Fits Your Life</h2>

 <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-navy/80">
 <p>
 I offer virtual therapy exclusively. For Oakville residents, this means you're not adding another trip to an already packed schedule. No fighting traffic on Trafalgar or trying to squeeze in an appointment between meetings.
 </p>

 <p>
 Sessions happen wherever you're comfortable. Your home office. A quiet room after the kids are in bed. Wherever you can actually focus and be yourself.
 </p>

 <div class="bg-warm-white p-6 rounded-xl border border-sand my-8">
 <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy mb-4">What virtual therapy looks like:</h3>
 <ul class="space-y-2">
 <li>Secure video sessions (similar to Zoom but healthcare-compliant)</li>
 <li>50-minute appointments</li>
 <li>Same-week availability for new clients</li>
 <li>Evening and weekend options available</li>
 <li>No software to download. Just click a link</li>
 </ul>
 </div>

 <p>
 I've been doing virtual therapy for years. It works. For some people, it works better than in-person because you're in your own space, more comfortable, more yourself.
 </p>

 <p>
 Serving Oakville and all areas including Downtown, Bronte, Glen Abbey, Joshua Creek, Kerr Village, West Oak Trails, and Old Oakville. But honestly, location doesn't matter. If you're anywhere in Ontario, we can work together.
