- **Primary keywords to check:**
  1. homesick university

## üéØ EXPECTED OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY

**This is a "Polish the Diamond" Optimization:**

The page is ALREADY working (18.75% CTR proves it). We just need small tweaks to reach #1-3.

### Title/Meta Strategy:
- **Current title works!** (18.75% CTR proves it)
- Likely small keyword density improvements
- Preserve emotional hooks that drive clicks
- Possibly add "therapy" or "help" if missing

### Content Strategy:
- Add missing FAQ questions competitors have
- Expand on what's already working
- Don't rebuild from scratch (preserve what works)
- Target 3-5 additional high-volume questions

### Internal Linking:
- Link to student-anxiety page (related cluster)
- Link from student-anxiety to homesick (bidirectional)
- Create university mental health cluster

## üéì KEY STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

### 1. "Polish the Diamond" Approach
Unlike previous pages (rescue missions), this page is ALREADY performing well:
- Already Page 1
- Highest CTR of any therapy page
- Just needs final push to top 3

**Strategy:** Small optimizations that preserve what's working

### 2. Preserve the 18.75% CTR
Whatever is in the current title/meta is VERY compelling:
- Don't do a complete rewrite
- Enhance, don't replace
- Test small improvements
- Monitor CTR doesn't drop

### 3. Fastest Timeline Yet
From #5.94 ‚Üí #1-3 is much faster than:
- #79 ‚Üí #30-50 (counselling ontario)
- #86 ‚Üí #30-50 (virtual therapy)
- #5.8 + new keywords (student anxiety)

**Expected:** 2-4 weeks, not 6!

### 4. University Cluster Building
This page connects to:
- student-anxiety (already optimized)
- failing-university-anxiety (could optimize next)
- first-year-university-anxiety (already optimized)

Creating a strong university mental health cluster improves all pages.

## üí° HYPOTHESIS

**Why We're #5.94 Not #1-3:**

Possible reasons (to validate with data):
1. Missing key FAQ questions that #1-4 have
2. Lower keyword density than top pages
3. Fewer internal links (authority signal)
4. Less comprehensive content
5. Missing related keywords in content

**Our Advantage:**
- 18.75% CTR = Title/meta already better than competitors
- This suggests we have the BEST title/description
- Just need content/technical improvements to match

**Expected Result:**
Small optimizations should quickly move us to #1-3 because we're already close and have the best CTR.

---

**Status:** WAITING FOR DATA (Perplexity + Ahrefs)
**Expected Completion:** 2-4 weeks after data received
**Confidence Level:** VERY HIGH (best starting position of any optimization)

---

**This should be our easiest win yet!** The page is already performing well - we just need to push it across the finish line to top 3. üöÄ
