            <h2 class="section-title">What Is Perfectionism?</h2>
            <p><strong>Perfectionism is a psychological pattern characterized by setting unrealistically high standards, harsh self-criticism when those standards aren't met, and deriving self-worth primarily from achievement and external validation.</strong> Research shows perfectionism has increased 33% since 1989, particularly among young professionals in competitive fields. Unlike healthy striving, maladaptive perfectionism drives burnout, anxiety, and paradoxically decreases performance over time. Evidence-based therapy using ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) helps individuals set realistic standards while maintaining motivation and achievement.</p>

                    <h3 class="faq-question">What is perfectionism and is it really a problem?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Here's what I've seen: perfectionism isn't about having high standards. It's about deriving your entire self-worth from achievement. The goal keeps moving—each success just raises the bar. Research shows perfectionism has increased 33% since 1989, and it correlates with anxiety, depression, and burnout. It's not a personality quirk; it's a pattern that's exhausting you.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">How does therapy help with perfectionism?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">The goal isn't to lower your standards—it's to separate your worth from your productivity. ACT therapy helps you change your relationship with the "not good enough" thoughts so they stop running your decisions. You can still pursue excellence without the internal torture. That's not the problem. The problem is the suffering that comes with it.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">Will I lose my drive if I stop being a perfectionist?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Here's what I've seen: the opposite happens. Perfectionism is actually inefficient—you're spending energy on catastrophic thinking, <a href="/rumination-therapy.html">rumination</a>, and self-criticism instead of actual work. When that noise quiets down, most people become more productive, not less. The drive stays; the suffering doesn't have to.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">How long does perfectionism therapy take?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Most professionals notice shifts within a few sessions—not because perfectionism disappears, but because you're relating to it differently. Deeper changes usually happen over 12-16 sessions. We start practical from session one.</p>
