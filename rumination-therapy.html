                <h2 class="section-title">What Is Rumination?</h2>
                <p><strong>Rumination is the pattern of repetitive, unproductive thinking where the mind cycles through the same thoughts, concerns, or past events without reaching resolution or taking action.</strong> Unlike problem-solving, which moves toward solutions, rumination gets stuck in loops—replaying conversations that already happened, rehearsing scenarios that may never occur, and analyzing decisions that can't be changed. For many professionals, rumination peaks at night when the distractions of the day fall away and the mind finally has "processing time" it demands.</p>
                <p>Rumination is exhausting precisely because it feels productive—you're "working on" the problem—but leads nowhere. Research shows rumination is associated with increased anxiety, depression, and insomnia, yet thought suppression ("just stop thinking about it") reliably makes it worse. Effective therapy doesn't try to force the brain quiet; it changes your relationship with the thoughts so they pass without hooking you.</p>

                        <p>Rumination disguises itself as productive thinking. "I'm just working through this." But after 20 minutes without new insight or action, you're not problem-solving—you're stuck in a loop.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq-question">Why can't I turn my brain off at night?</h3>
                        <p class="faq-answer">Here's what I've seen: when you finally lie down, your brain sees that as its first chance to process everything you pushed aside during the day. All the unresolved stuff—tomorrow's worries, today's regrets—finally has your attention. It's not a flaw. Your brain is doing what it thinks is helpful, just at the worst possible time. We work on changing your relationship with those thoughts, not forcing them quiet.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq-question">Is rumination a sign of anxiety or depression?</h3>
                        <p class="faq-answer">It can show up in both, but the flavor is different. Anxiety rumination is future-focused—"What if this goes wrong?" Depression rumination is past-focused—"Why did I do that?" But here's the thing: rumination is a thinking pattern we can work on regardless of whether you have a formal diagnosis. A lot of high-functioning professionals ruminate without meeting criteria for anxiety or depression. The pattern is the pattern.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq-question">What's the difference between problem-solving and rumination?</h3>
                        <p class="faq-answer">Problem-solving moves somewhere—you identify the issue, weigh options, decide, act. Rumination circles. You're replaying things you can't change, rehearsing conversations that may never happen, re-analyzing decisions already made. Here's a test: if you've been thinking about the same thing for 20 minutes without a new insight or action step, you've crossed over from thinking to ruminating. That distinction matters.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq-question">Why doesn't "just stop thinking about it" work?</h3>
                        <p class="faq-answer">Because fighting thoughts gives them power. Research shows trying not to think about something makes you think about it more—it's called the "white bear" phenomenon. That's why "just relax" is such useless advice. We take a different approach: instead of fighting your thoughts, you learn to observe them without getting hooked. You can have a racing thought and let it pass without chasing it. Paradoxically, that's when the thoughts lose their grip.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq-question">How does ACT therapy help with racing thoughts?</h3>
                        <p class="faq-answer">ACT works on defusion—learning to see thoughts as just thoughts, not commands you have to follow or facts you have to believe. Instead of trying to stop the racing, you practice observing from a slight distance. "I'm having the thought that I'll fail" creates more space than "I'll fail." That space is everything. It lets you notice the thought and redirect your attention to what actually matters, rather than getting pulled into the spiral.</p>
