   - Actually ranking for: "burlington online therapy" (332 impressions)
   
3. **❌ Duplicate Pages:** Two pages both targeting "online therapy burlington" (2.4K volume)

## 🎯 EXPECTED OUTCOMES (4-6 Weeks)

### Impression Changes:

**anxiety-therapy-burlington.html:**
- Current: 739 impressions (mostly wrong keywords)
- Target: 400-600 impressions for correct keyword
- Query shift: "online therapy burlington" → "anxiety therapy burlington"

**burlington-online-therapy.html:**
- Current: 657 impressions
- + Redirect: 920 impressions from virtual-therapy-burlington
- **= Target: 1,400-1,600 impressions** (consolidated)

**Combined:**
- Before: 2,316 impressions split inefficiently
- After: 2,000-2,200 impressions across 2 well-targeted pages

### Ranking Improvements:

1. **Anxiety page should rank better for:**
   - "anxiety therapy burlington" (2.2K volume)
   - "anxiety therapist burlington"
   - "panic attacks burlington"
   - "social anxiety therapy burlington"

2. **Online therapy page should rank better for:**
   - "online therapy burlington" (2.4K volume - PRIMARY)
   - "burlington online therapy"
   - "virtual therapy burlington"
   - "online therapist burlington"

### CTR Changes:

**Note:** This consolidation fixes TARGETING, not CTR.

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FROM THIS PROCESS

### What We Learned:

1. **✅ Ahrefs Can Be Wrong:**
   - Ahrefs classified keywords as "informational"
   - But they're actually "hybrid informational-transactional"
   - Trust GSC query data over Ahrefs intent classification

2. **✅ Competitor Analysis Matters:**
   - Inner Oak has separate pages per service (anxiety, depression, PTSD)
   - They DON'T have multiple pages for same service
   - We copied their structure: anxiety-specific + general hub

3. **✅ Parent Topics Are Critical:**
   - "depression therapy burlington" parent topic → "anxiety therapy burlington"
   - This tells us they're related and should link to each other
   - Future: Create depression page and link to anxiety page

4. **✅ GSC Query Data Reveals Truth:**
   - anxiety-therapy-burlington was getting wrong traffic
   - Simple content refocus should fix this
   - File name ≠ content focus = Google gets confused

5. **✅ Word Count Sweet Spot:**
   - Not 1,200 (too short for therapy trust-building)
   - Not 8,000 (too long, dilutes focus)  
   - 2,500-4,000 seems optimal for therapy pages
