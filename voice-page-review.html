                        <p>I'm Jesse Cynamon, a Registered Psychotherapist with the College of Registered Psychotherapists of Ontario (<a href="https://my.crpo.ca/Portal/Content/Public-Register/Public-Register-Profile.aspx?ID=21403&ck=CA559D8F-6580-4B33-843F-B93695B435D3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CRPO #10979</a>). I focus on helping people throughout Ontario develop a healthier relationship with anxiety using evidence-based approaches like Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).</p>
                        <h3>Why I Work with Anxiety</h3>
                        <p>Anxiety often affects some of the most capable, thoughtful people—individuals who care deeply about their responsibilities and relationships. What makes this work meaningful to me is witnessing the profound relief that comes when someone learns they don't need to eliminate anxiety to live well; they just need to change their relationship with it.</p>

                        <p>Here's what I've seen: anxiety often shows up in the most capable people around. The goal isn't to eliminate anxiety. It's to stop letting it run your life. I don't have all the answers. But I can walk through the unknown with you.</p>

                        <p>Anxiety therapy isn't about me telling you what to do or analyzing your childhood for months. It's about building a collaborative partnership where you develop practical skills for managing anxiety while working toward the life you want to live.</p>
                        <h3>Building Your Toolkit</h3>
                        <p>Each session includes practical elements you can apply immediately. You're not just talking about anxiety—you're building a comprehensive set of skills for managing it in real-world situations.</p>

                        <p>No homework. No worksheets. Just real conversations about what's going on. I use approaches that research supports. But what matters more is whether we actually connect.</p>
                        <h3>What We Explore</h3>
                        <p>There's this tension between who you think you should be and who you actually want to be. That's often where the pain lives. We figure out what's in your control and what's not. We explore that gap together.</p>
