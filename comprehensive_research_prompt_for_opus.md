# Comprehensive Research Prompt: NextStepTherapy pSEO Strategy Validation

## Context & Background

I'm Jesse, a therapist in Ontario running NextStepTherapy.ca, and I've been developing a "neutral brand + programmatic SEO" strategy to scale my therapy business. I need comprehensive research and validation of this model, including regulatory compliance, market viability, and a roadmap to $500k annual profit.

## Current Business Foundation

### Existing Website Analysis (nextsteptherapy.ca)
- **Current Positioning**: Performance-focused therapy for high-achieving professionals in Ontario
- **Service Model**: 100% virtual therapy across Ontario
- **Credentials**: Registered Psychotherapist (CRPO)
- **Current Services**: Work anxiety, executive performance, burnout therapy
- **Unique Value**: Feedback-informed therapy with validated measurement tools
- **Target Market**: Professionals in medicine, law, finance, tech, sports

### Core Strategic Concept: "The Therapy Platform Play"
Instead of niching down to one specialty, create a neutral brand with 50+ hyper-targeted landing pages for different therapy niches. Think "Amazon of therapy" - neutral brand that can serve any need through data-driven niche selection.

**Architecture Example:**
```
NextStepTherapy (Neutral Brand)
├── ADHD Services (adults, women, entrepreneurs, late diagnosis)
├── Men's Mental Health (therapy, anger, fathers, anxiety)
├── Professional Burnout (executives, lawyers, doctors, prevention)
├── Performance Issues (imposter syndrome, perfectionism, anxiety)
├── Life Transitions (career change, divorce, retirement)
└── [20+ more categories based on data]
```

## Market Research Findings

### Top Market Gaps Identified (Toronto/Ontario)

4. **Men's Mental Health Services** - Massively underserved demographic
5. **ADHD Therapy for Adults** - Huge demand, limited specialists
6. **Burnout Prevention vs Crisis** - Most services are crisis-focused, not preventive

### 100+ Keyword Targets Identified
Categories include: industry-specific confidential care, after-hours scheduling, professional performance anxiety, ADHD therapy for adults, men's mental health, burnout prevention, career transitions, work-life integration, imposter syndrome, and specialized trauma treatment.
