## QUICK TIPS FOR EACH AI TOOL

### Using Bing Image Creator (Free):
1. Add "minimal professional website design" to every prompt
2. Add "white background" explicitly
3. Add "no photography" to avoid realistic images
4. Generate in square format for icons

### Using DALL-E 3 (ChatGPT):
1. Start prompts with "Create a minimalist..."
2. End with "...for modern therapy website"
3. Specify "vector illustration style"
4. Ask for "predominantly white composition"

### Using Midjourney:
1. Always add: `--no photo,people,faces,complex --ar 1:1`
2. Use `--style raw` for cleaner output
3. Add "minimal geometric illustration" to prompt
4. Keep chaos at 0 for consistency: `--chaos 0`

## EXAMPLE FULL PROMPT FOR HERO

Here's exactly what to paste into DALL-E/Bing for your hero image:

```
Create a minimalist abstract watercolor background for a therapy website hero section.
Use extremely light sage green (#8FA68E) at 15% opacity creating soft, organic
cloud-like shapes flowing horizontally across a pure white background. Add tiny hints
of soft blue (#6B9BD1) at 10% opacity. The composition should be 90% white space
with colors barely visible, like morning mist. Leave center-left area clear for
text overlay. Size: 1920x1080. Style: Minimal Scandinavian design meets modern
wellness website. No objects, people, or scenery - only abstract color washes.
```
